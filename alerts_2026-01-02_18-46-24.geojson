Doing so may breach the FIA’s regulations and leave a lasting stain on motor sports.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set out how businesses should implement policies and conduct due diligence in regards to their impact on human rights. Such due diligence should include the risk of laundering the reputations of governments, businesses, or individuals responsible for ongoing or recent serious rights abuses.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has previously raised rights concerns in connection with FIA and Formula 1 activities in&nbsp;Azerbaijan and&nbsp;Saudi Arabia, where abusive governments have used motor sports to whitewash their reputations.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the assemblies in Tashkent, Human Rights Watch&nbsp;asked the FIA and&nbsp;Formula 1, who adopted a&nbsp;commitment to respect human rights, their plans to discuss rights issues during the assemblies and the type of due diligence they conduct. We received no response.</p><p>FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, recently&nbsp;re-elected for a second term, should seize this opportunity to take much stronger human rights actions in Uzbekistan and globally. The federation should use its influence with governments to urge rights reforms and roll out comprehensive due diligence to identify and remedy any adverse rights impact of its activities and ensure that&nbsp;motor sports continue to “drive society forward.”</p>",

Since September, the administration has carried out more than two dozen strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in&nbsp;at least 99&nbsp;extrajudicial killings. This context raises the concern that the order aims to facilitate an expansion of such unlawful actions.</p><p>The executive order is also dangerous in the current domestic context, following months of National Guard deployments to multiple&nbsp;US cities. While US law enforcement agencies commit many&nbsp;human rights abuses, the involvement of the military in law enforcement would pose&nbsp;additional risks. Military forces bring fundamentally different training and experience to bear, focused less on rights-respecting law enforcement and more on the effective use of lethal force.</p><p>While governments have a legitimate interest in working to stop drug trafficking, addressing the harm of unregulated fentanyl requires an emphasis on&nbsp;evidence-based public health&nbsp;interventions. Militarized policing in US communities could unleash serious abuses, especially against Black and other&nbsp;overpoliced communities. US drug policy has historically fueled&nbsp;racially discriminatory policing, arrests, and incarceration. It has not adequately addressed harm caused by drug trafficking, like overdose deaths, which disproportionately affect Black and Indigenous people, who face&nbsp;disparities in health care access.</p><p>The administration should channel concern about fentanyl into&nbsp;harm reduction strategies that safeguard rights, rather than calling it a weapon of mass destruction to create the illusion of a threat that warrants military action.</p>",

Last week, countries gathered at the UN in Geneva to explore ways of strengthening international law around access to free pre-primary and secondary education. At least 74 countries from all regions participated, reflecting broad and sustained interest in an initiative led by Sierra Leone and the Dominican Republic.</p><p>It is low- and lower-middle-income countries that are taking the lead on the initiative, having already demonstrated their commitment to children’s education by introducing national reforms. In particular, Sierra Leone has enshrined 13 years of free schooling from pre-primary through secondary education in law. Malawi, the newest member of the group of leading states, will introduce free secondary education in 2026.</p><p>New treaty provisions are being discussed because, as Sierra Leone’s education minister recently highlighted, while existing international law guarantees children free primary education, the Convention on the Rights of the Child says nothing explicit about early childhood or pre-primary education, nor does it require states to guarantee every child free secondary education. A UNESCO report released last week also highlighted these gaps.</p><p>An obvious solution to fill these gaps would be to update the Convention on the Rights of the Child through a new optional protocol. This approach would create legally binding obligations, push governments to reform laws and policies, and ensure real oversight and accountability. Such a protocol would mean millions of children—especially those from low-income families, girls, and children with disabilities—could dramatically improve their opportunities and life outcomes.</p><p>Support for the initiative is growing and at the meeting, two more countries announced their support, bringing those publicly backing the process to 60, while many other countries, particularly African, European, and Latin American countries, reaffirmed their commitment to moving the initiative forward. However, there is still resistance, with the United Kingdom and Belgium maintaining their opposition, this time joined by Russia.</p><p>More than 400 million children are out of school from pre-primary through secondary often simply because their families cannot afford it. The time is now to take bold action and move forward with updating the Convention on the Rights of the Child, so that every child, everywhere, can claim the education to which they are entitled.</p>",

The indefinite and widespread nature of these practices is fundamentally inconsistent with the United States’ obligations to ensure that law enforcement abuses are investigated and met with accountability.</p><p>“Law enforcement officers must be identifiable to be accountable,” said&nbsp;Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “This kind of secrecy should be an exception, never the norm, and it’s even more alarming given the widespread abuses associated with immigration arrests in recent months.”</p><p>Since President Donald Trump’s return to office in January 2025, his administration has carried out an&nbsp;abusive&nbsp;campaign of immigration raids and arrests, primarily of people of color, across the country. Many of the raids target places where Latino people work, shop, eat, and live. The agents have&nbsp;seized people in courthouses and at&nbsp;regularly-scheduled&nbsp;appointments with immigration officials, as well as in places of worship,&nbsp;schools, and other sensitive locations. Many raids have been marked by the sudden and&nbsp;unprovoked use of force without any justification, creating a climate of&nbsp;fear in many immigrant communities.</p><p>These immigration enforcement operations have often involved Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and, in some cases, civilian clothes. Agents are regularly concealing agency insignias and using unmarked vehicles to detain people who are in their cars and at courthouses, schools, workplaces, homes, on the street, and in public transport.&nbsp;</p><p>On its website, ICE&nbsp;justifies the widespread practice of masking “to prevent doxing.” This kind of generalized, blanket justification for concealing officers’ identity is not compatible with US human rights obligations, except when necessary and proportionate to address particular safety concerns, Human Rights Watch said. When applied as a broad, default approach, such measures serve as a barrier to accountability inconsistent with US human rights obligations. Anonymity also weakens deterrence, fosters conditions for impunity, and chills the exercise of rights.</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people who witnessed arrests by or who were arrested by unidentifiable people in five US cities since January 20. They all described the incidents as frightening, with a sense that they couldn’t do anything if they were abused, especially with the agents unidentifiable. Human Rights Watch also reviewed dozens of videos of&nbsp;stops and&nbsp;arrests involving&nbsp;masked agents&nbsp;posted on&nbsp;social&nbsp;media.</p><p>In one example, on March 25 at about 5:15 p.m., at least six officers, all in civilian dress and unmarked vehicles, without identifying themselves, confronted and stopped Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, 30, who was apparently targeted for writing an&nbsp;opinion piece in a student newspaper calling on Tufts to “acknowledge the&nbsp;Palestinian genocide” and divest from&nbsp;investments connected to Israel. Öztürk, who had been living in the United States for six years, told Human Rights Watch about the incident, which was also captured on CCTV&nbsp;footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Öztürk was walking on the street when several masked people approached her, forcibly took her phone and backpack, and placed her in handcuffs. Öztürk said when she asked who they were and to see their badges, one said they were “police” and one flashed a gold necklace, but she did not see a badge attached, and it did not help her identify them. In the footage, a bystander is heard asking the agents: “Why are you hiding your faces?” Öztürk said she was not shown any paperwork justifying her arrest. She was then forcibly removed from the state and wrongfully&nbsp;detained.</p><p>“It was a horrible feeling,” Öztürk said. “I didn’t think that they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this. I thought they were people who were doxing me, and I was genuinely very afraid for my safety… As a woman who’s traveled and lived alone in various countries for my studies, I’ve never experienced intense fear for my safety—until that moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>One woman who has witnessed numerous raids and stops in Chicago since August said: “I’ve had experiences with agents who refused to identify themselves. That adds another level of fear. These are not identifiable police officers who could be held publicly accountable.” A man from Washington, DC, who has also witnessed numerous arrests by masked ICE agents since August, said these tactics have “completely destroyed any trust we’ve had for local and federal law enforcement.”</p><p>Many observers have suggested that the terror these tactics instill is by design. One US District Court judge asserted in a&nbsp;ruling&nbsp;that “ICE goes masked for a single reason—to terrorize Americans into quiescence… We have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The court dismissed ICE’s stated rationale for masking as “disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable.”</p><p>In recent months, media outlets have reported on people posing as federal agents&nbsp;kidnapping,&nbsp;sexually assaulting, and&nbsp;extorting victims, exploiting fears of immigration enforcement. This demonstrates how the lines can be blurred between criminals and law enforcement officers when federal agents themselves are unidentifiable, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Several&nbsp;states are taking steps to pass&nbsp;legislation to restrict law enforcement officers from&nbsp;concealing their&nbsp;identities during public interactions. It is unlikely these initiatives would be enforceable. At the federal level, the proposed&nbsp;VISIBLE Act, backed by Senators Cory Booker and Alex Padilla, would mandate legible identification and prohibit nonmedical face coverings for immigration enforcement officers.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress should investigate the brutality of the ongoing immigration enforcement activities, including the specific impacts of unidentifiable agents carrying out stops and arrests on impeding investigations and accountability efforts, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Allowing masked, unidentified agents to roam communities and apprehend people without identifying themselves erodes trusts in the rule of law and creates a dangerous vacuum where abuses can flourish, exacerbating the unnecessary violence and brutality of the arrests,” Wille said.</p>",

Other independent journalists have been under pressure from government officials and their social media accounts have been taken down. On December 2, the website of an independent media outlet experienced a distributed denial of service attack, to make a website unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.</p><p>The Kazakhstan government has repeatedly pledged to uphold the right to freedom of expression, consistent with its Constitution and international obligations, including in January at its&nbsp;fourth Universal Periodic Review at the UN.</p><p>On December 1, police in Almaty&nbsp;detained Gulnara Bazhkenova, editor-in-chief of the independent news outlet Orda.kz, as a person of interest in several criminal cases, including for allegedly spreading “repeated and deliberate” false information. On the same day, a court ordered her held for&nbsp;two months of house arrest, her lawyer said.</p><p>Bazhkenova was arrested following a&nbsp;police search of the Almaty newsroom of Orda.kz and Bazhkenova’s home. The outlet’s legal representatives and staff said that investigative teams seized documents, equipment, and money for staff salaries. They forced open a safe. Officials physically searched Bazhkenova and an accountant. The authorities at the office denied Orda.kz’s lawyers permission to enter even though the lawyers had proper authorization, and barred them from reviewing the search warrant, both criminal procedural code violations.</p><p>On the same day in Astana, police questioned Dmitry Kim, head of Orda.kz’s capital bureau, for several hours at the outlet’s office and later took him to a police station. He was released the same day.</p><p>On November 28, independent journalists Lukpan Akhmedyarov and Raul Uporov published a&nbsp;documentary film, “The Duty of the Motherland,” on their&nbsp;YouTube channel&nbsp;“Prosto Journalistika” (JustJournalism_kz), highlighting the deaths of 270 Kazakhstani soldiers over the past three years. Most were conscripts who apparently died following illnesses, weapons-related incidents, or suicides.</p><p>The film followed a protest on November 10 in Astana, where mothers of deceased and injured soldiers gathered outside the House of Ministries demanding accountability and justice for soldiers’ deaths and injuries.</p><p>Akhmedyarov told the rights groups and&nbsp;reported in the media that several days before the film’s release, he received a phone call from a contact in the Defense Ministry relaying a request from “a high-ranking official” to avoid “stirring up the issue with the army.” After Akhmedyarov published a Facebook post about the threat, his&nbsp;Facebook account became inaccessible for three days.</p><p>A separate Instagram account he ran for his “Just Journalism” project&nbsp;was temporarily removed in July. He said it was a targeted attack.</p><p>The Facebook incident appears to be the latest of a recent string of interference in online expression in Kazakhstan. In late November, the Instagram accounts of&nbsp;three other independent voices in Kazakhstan became inaccessible or were temporarily removed.</p><p>Vadim Boreyko, an independent journalist based in Almaty,&nbsp;reported on November 22 that he found his Instagram account emptied of content. He described the incident as the latest in multiple instances of harassment that includes repeated removals of older posts on Instagram and Facebook for vague “violations.” Since then, the content on his account appears to have been restored.</p><p>An Almaty-based activist, Askhat Niyazov, received notification on his Instagram that his account had been removed for “community guidelines violations.” On November 28, another Almaty-based activist, Sanjar Bokayev, received notification on Instagram that his account had been removed for “community guidelines violations.” Their accounts have since been restored. On November 30, Bokayev’s account on Facebook was blocked “for security reasons.” It too has been restored.</p><p>On December 12, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, asking about the temporary blocking and removal of accounts and if these actions had been taken in response to Kazakhstan government requests. Meta responded saying that they “strive to notify users and share information externally” about taking action on content that violates local law, but were unable to respond substantively to the specific questions posed by the time of publication.</p><p>The editorial team of the independent outlet Vlast.kz&nbsp;reported on December 2 that its website had experienced intensive DDoS attacks over several days, especially on December 2. They said the attacks caused significant interruptions to the website’s operations.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s parliament has also&nbsp;advanced legislation severely restricting the rights and visibility of LGBTI individuals, including broad and vaguely defined prohibitions on public expression relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. These provisions pose a direct threat not only to people identifying as LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex), but also to journalists, academics, artists, human rights defenders, and civil society actors who risk administrative sanctions for reporting on or advocating for the rights of these groups, or for expressing positive views of LGBTI rights publicly or online.</p><p>Such measures constitute discrimination and violate Kazakhstan’s Constitution, including guarantees of equality before the law and freedom of expression, as well as the country’s binding obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>They also contradict Kazakhstan’s commitments within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe framework to uphold pluralism, tolerance, and non-discrimination, as well as international standards articulated by UN experts. The experts have repeatedly emphasized that states may not restrict expression relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to suppress public debate or silence marginalized groups.</p><p>“The advancement of so-called propaganda legislation is not only blatantly homophobic and discriminatory, but it also marks a dangerous expansion of state control over public discourse and further erodes the already shrinking civic space in the country,” said Leila Seiitbek, director of Freedom for Eurasia. “On December 18, when the bill goes to a vote in Kazakhstan’s Senate, lawmakers should decisively vote against this harmful piece of legislation.”</p><p>The Kazakhstan government, in particular the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor General’s Office, should cease harassment, intimidation, and pressure against journalists and media outlets, the groups said. It should protect the public’s right to access to information, and cease spurious criminal investigations into independent journalists, including against Bazhkenova.</p><p>The authorities should also withdraw the discriminatory “propaganda” bill. Kazakhstan should guarantee the right to freedom of expression for all and ensure that government policies promote tolerance and nondiscrimination.</p><p>Social media platforms should respect the human rights of users in Kazakhstan and resist any content or account takedown requests that unlawfully restrict expression protected under international human rights law, the groups also said.</p><p>“Unfounded restrictions on journalists and freedom of expression are long-standing rights issues in Kazakhstan,” said Mihra Rittmann, Central Asia adviser at Human Rights Watch. “The government needs to stop all attacks on independent journalists and media outlets and create an enabling environment for freedom of expression.”</p>",

An appeals court is scheduled to hear his case on December 25.</p><p>A misdemeanor court convicted Farouk of “disseminating false news” under the penal code for criticizing Egypt’s economic policy and alleging government corruption. Egyptian authorities have violated Farouk’s right to freedom of expression as well as his due process rights, including his right to a fair trial. He is currently being held under conditions that raise concerns for his health and he said he is being ill-treated.</p><p>“Prosecuting a prominent economist solely for his speech and analysis reflects the dangerous level of repression in Egypt today, casting economic research and intellectual debate as criminal acts,” said&nbsp;Amr Magdi, senior Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should immediately release Dr. Farouk, whose long imprisonment is just the latest case in which Egypt’s government makes a mockery of free speech guarantees and due process rights.”</p><p>Security forces raided Farouk’s home in Cairo on October 20, 2024, arrested him, and confiscated his phone, laptop, and unpublished draft writings, his wife, Nagla Salama, told Human Rights Watch. They also confiscated her laptop and phone and have not returned them.</p><p>Two days before his arrest, Farouk published a Facebook&nbsp;post, “The Theft of the Century,” compiling 40 of his articles about economic subjects including the military’s&nbsp;encroachment into the civilian economy and its opaque business dealings. Human Rights Watch reviewed a selection of Farouk’s posts and found that they criticize President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, other officials, and the Egyptian military.&nbsp;</p><p>While the authorities have previously detained Farouk several times for his writings, his wife said his current detention conditions at the 10th of Ramadan prison complex are “by far the worst.” She said he is kept in near-total isolation, locked in his cell for 23 hours a day with two other prisoners. He is allowed one hour outside his cell, but in an enclosed space without sunlight and is denied meaningful contact with others.</p><p>Following Farouk’s arrest, the Supreme State Security Prosecution interrogated him about his writings stretching back several years,&nbsp;his wife and lawyer said. The authorities charged him under article 80(d) and article 102 bis of the penal code concerning “disseminating false statements,” his lawyer, Nabih el-Genady said. Both articles have been used to criminalize peaceful speech, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Since his arrest, the authorities have held Farouk in pretrial detention without bail. Human Rights Watch has documented that Egyptian authorities since 2013 have imposed unjustified, prolonged pretrial detention to punish critics and stifle dissent. The authorities have conducted Farouq’s pretrial detention renewal hearings remotely through a video system without bringing him physically before a judge. The remote hearings system widely used in recent years&nbsp;exacerbates abusive pretrial detention in violation of international law.</p><p>The Shorouk Misdemeanor Court, a first instance court for minor offenses, did not formally notify Farouk’s lawyers of his initial court hearing on September 25 and denied them access to the approximately 500-page case file, his lawyer said. The court issued the five-year sentence at the second hearing without allowing for a meaningful defense. His wife said that Farouq only learned of the verdict on October 7, when she was visiting him.&nbsp;</p><p>The appeal has already raised due process concerns. His lawyers said that the appeals court allowed them to only briefly read the case file in court but did not permit them to make a copy for review.</p><p>The Egyptian authorities should immediately release Farouk and all other prisoners held for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, including&nbsp;Ismail Iskandarani, a researcher, and&nbsp;Ashraf Omar, a cartoonist, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, both of which Egypt has ratified, guarantee everyone the right to freedom of expression, to a fair and public hearing, and to adequate time and resources to prepare a defense.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which authoritatively interprets the covenant,&nbsp;requires any limitations on free expression to be proportionate, stated in a precise manner, in a way to enable people to reasonably predict what constitutes a violation, and necessary to protect national security, public order, public health, or morals in a democratic society.&nbsp;</p><p>The committee has also&nbsp;stated that the right to a fair trial, including appeals, requires “access to documents and other evidence” including “all materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that are exculpatory.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The prosecution of Dr. Farouk is just the latest case in which Egyptian authorities have sought to secure a brutally harsh sentence as punishment for those who criticize Sisi’s government and its policies,” Magdi said. “Such abuses not only strangle the space for freedom of expression in the country but deprive Egyptian society of the ability to contest the government’s economic policies amid widespread poverty and economic crises.”</p>",
