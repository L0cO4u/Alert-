<p>(Berlin, November 28, 2025) – Russia’s designation of Human Rights Watch as an “undesirable” foreign organization, made public by the Ministry of Justice on November 28, is yet another mark of the Kremlin’s repression, Human Rights Watch said today. The designation bans the organization’s work in Russia.</p><p>“For over three decades, Human Rights Watch’s work on post-Soviet Russia has pressed the government to uphold human rights and freedoms,” said Philippe Bolopion, executive director at Human Rights Watch. “Our work hasn’t changed, but what’s changed, dramatically, is the government’s full-throttled embrace of dictatorial policies, its staggering rise in repression, and the scope of the war crimes its forces are committing in Ukraine.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Prosecutor General’s Office made the decision to ban Human Rights Watch on November 10, as follows from the Ministry of Justice’s register of “undesirable” organizations updated today. The official reasons for the designation are not known.</p><p>In 2022, six weeks after Russia initiated its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities revoked the registration for the Human Rights Watch Moscow office, which had operated in Russia since 1992. The office had to shut down as a result, but our work continued. Human Rights Watch started working on Russia in 1978, during the Soviet era.</p><p>The law on “undesirable” organizations is one of the most powerful tools in the arsenal of repressive laws Russian authorities have adopted in recent years to silence all criticism of the government and incapacitate independent civic organizations.</p><p>Under Russia’s 2015 legislation, the prosecutor’s office can designate as “undesirable” any foreign or international organization that allegedly undermines Russia’s security, defense, or constitutional order. “Undesirable” organizations and their materials are banned in Russia. Individuals who continue to engage with these organizations, either in Russia or abroad, may face administrative and criminal penalties, including a maximum six-year prison sentence. The authorities interpret “engagement” widely and arbitrarily.</p><p>In 2021, Andrei Pivovarov, a political activist, received a four-year prison sentence for social media posts which the authorities said promoted Open Russia, a political opposition movement designated “undesirable.” Russian authorities released and expelled him from the country in 2024. In May 2025, a Moscow court sentenced a prominent Russian rights defender and election monitor, Grigory Melkonyants, to five years in prison after authorities wrongly equated the Russian election monitoring group Golos with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, designated “undesirable” in 2021.</p><p>The Political Prisoners Project of Memorial, a leading Russian rights group, recognized both activists as political prisoners.</p><p>Russian authorities have designated at least 280 organizations as “undesirable,” and courts have issued administrative and criminal sentences, including in absentia, against hundreds of individuals. Among those designated undesirable are prominent civil society foundations, human rights groups, environmental organizations, and leading Russian independent media, many of whose members and staff had to leave the country and reestablish elsewhere as foreign entities to continue their work.</p><p>Since its adoption, international human rights bodies and experts have repeatedly criticized the “undesirable organizations” legislation, including the&nbsp;UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, a rapporteur for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the&nbsp;Venice Commission, an advisory body to the Council of Europe. The UN&nbsp;Human Rights Committee, which interprets the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the&nbsp;UN special rapporteur on Russia urged Russian authorities to revise or repeal it.</p><p>“Designating rights groups undesirable is brazen and cynical,” Bolopion said. “It only redoubles our determination to document the Russian authorities’ human rights violations and war crimes, and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/28/russia-government-designates-human-rights-watch-undesirable,4,105.3188,61.524,2025-11-29T21:41:21.984997+00:00

<p>(Nairobi) – Concerns about irregularities, political interference, and security pressures risk putting the credibility and inclusiveness of key elections in the&nbsp;Central African Republic into question, Human Rights Watch said today. The vote, scheduled for December 28, 2025, will include presidential and parliamentary elections, but also municipal elections for the first time in decades.</p><p>“The Central African Republic election will shape the country’s political trajectory for years to come,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Despite tangible progress to establish peace, obstructions to opposition participation, administrative dysfunction, and concerns about a return to repression could disenfranchise large segments of the population.</p><p>The elections come after the highly controversial 2023 constitutional&nbsp;referendum, which removed presidential term limits and effectively opened the door for President Faustin-Archange Touadéra to remain in power indefinitely. The official campaign period is slated to start on December 13.</p><p>Two of the country’s most prominent political figures, former prime ministers Anicet Georges Dologuélé and Henri-Marie Dondra, were barred from entering the race until November 14, when the Constitutional Council&nbsp;decided to allow them to run as candidates for president. This aligned with an apparent pattern of administrative maneuvering that has disproportionately impeded opposition politicians while favoring the ruling United Hearts Party (known by its French acronym, MCU), Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The two politicians are widely viewed as the only credible challengers to Touadéra. “We have effectively been delayed while the MCU has been mobilizing,” Dologuélé told Human Rights Watch. Their late admission to the race raises questions about whether voters have been given a genuine choice, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>These developments come amid&nbsp;growing doubts about whether the National Election Authority is prepared to run the election. Supply-chain failures, incomplete voter lists, and insufficiently trained staff for polling places, particularly outside Bangui, the capital, are potential problems.</p><p>In Bangui, civil society activists have raised concerns over whether many of the estimated 6,700 polling places will be able to open on time, if at all. Rural voters, already hampered by insecurity and limited transportation, could find themselves effectively excluded. The lack of readiness not only undermines confidence in the process but also raises concerns that turnout figures may become deeply skewed toward the capital.</p><p>The government has sought to bolster confidence in elections by signing a series of&nbsp;peace accords with various armed groups. These accords, which skirt around accountability for human rights abuses and potential war crimes committed in the past, have nonetheless created conditions for stability not seen in years. However, several civil society activists, journalists, UN officials, and diplomats question the durability of these peace deals including an&nbsp;agreement signed on November 19 with the Patriotic Movement for the Central African Republic.</p><p>Over the past decade,&nbsp;numerous declarations of peace&nbsp;quickly fell apart amid unmet promises of disarmament, political inclusion, or resource sharing. One journalist told Human Rights Watch that, “Armed groups have been bought off to ensure the elections occur. Disarmament has become a racket…. [W]e will most likely see these groups resume attacks once the money runs out … [until] the next round of elections.”</p><p>Without genuine disarmament efforts, the current agreements will serve more as symbolic gestures reinforcing impunity than as mechanisms for lasting stability, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The unequal political environment has prompted many opposition parties to call for a full&nbsp;boycott of the elections. Leaders of Republican Bloc for the Defense of the Constitution, an opposition coalition, told Human Rights Watch that they are concerned about the obstruction of candidates, the election authority’s administrative deficiencies, and the government monopoly over media and state resources.</p><p>This boycott, and the delays experienced by Dologuélé and Dondra, will most likely pave the way for a parliament dominated by the current governing party. A legislature without meaningful opposition oversight risks compromising already weak institutions, Human Rights Watch said. “We need checks on the executive,” one politician told Human Rights Watch. “My fear is that these elections, already skewed, are a test of the principles of democratic accountability.”</p><p>There are also concerns around online xenophobic rhetoric. Dologuélé had to&nbsp;give up his French nationality to run for the presidency as individuals in high offices are not allowed to hold citizenship of another country. Nonetheless, some groups associated with the governing party are circulating statements online about “who is a real Central African,” targeting the opposition. Online attacks against opponents of the 2023 constitutional referendum&nbsp;ramped up before that vote.</p><p>Dondra told Human Rights Watch that in addition to other constraints, two of his brothers were arrested, and one remains in&nbsp;custody without charge, allegedly for politically motivated reasons.</p><p>The elections comes amid a&nbsp;planned reduction of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). The mission, which has a mandate to protect civilians and monitor human rights abuses, alongside supporting elections, is expected to scale down its presence partly due to the budget constraints across UN peacekeeping and a desire from some member states to see responsibility transferred to national authorities.</p><p>A diminished UN footprint could leave communities, particularly those in conflict-affected regions, exposed to militia coercion and retaliation if the peace accords do not hold. Some diplomats in Bangui told Human Rights Watch that the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the International Organization of the Francophonie, which may monitor elections, have not been confirmed one month before the vote and will most likely be unable to conduct any monitoring outside of Bangui.</p><p>Despite the concerns, civil society activists and journalists describe some improvements. “Things are better than they were a few years ago, the repression has let up,” one journalist told Human Rights Watch. “However, we must remain vigilant. Once it solidifies full control over the parliament and municipal offices, the MCU will control how we discuss government policy, security and development.” The authorities should ensure that journalists and activists can continue to do their work freely without fear of reprisals or repression, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>One month out, the government should remove all barriers to opposition participation and guarantee equal access to campaigning and to the media. The authorities should release individuals detained without credible legal basis, including Dondra’s brother. International partners should monitor the elections for conformity to international standards, and reductions in peacekeeping forces should be reconsidered if armed groups attack civilians again.</p><p>“The Central African Republic stands at crossroads, and credible elections cannot occur when legitimate concerns are unaddressed,” Mudge said. “The country’s path toward stability depends on inclusive and competitive political processes that reflect the will of all communities, not only those with access to power.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/28/central-african-republic-concerns-over-crucial-election,4,121.0504257,14.6446934,2025-11-29T21:41:23.536380+00:00

5bc925af34ce9dc14b57f30f2c90c554b0a12f500cb4e690765ef942a9ce4504,Yemen: Houthis’ Widespread Detentions of Political Opponents,"<p>(Beirut) – Houthi authorities have detained dozens of political opponents since July 2025, including the leaders of several political parties in&nbsp;Yemen, some of which may amount to enforced disappearances, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>At least 70 people associated with the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, known as the Islah party, were detained within 24 hours in Dhamar governorate on October 28.</p><p>The most recent detentions are part of a wider campaign over the last year and a half, targeting members of civil society, United Nations and nongovernmental organization staff, businesspeople, and even people within the Houthi authorities. At least 59 UN staff are in detention with no access to lawyers and limited, if any, access to their families. Concurrently, Houthis are escalating dubious accusations of espionage against people they have detained, including in a recent unfair trial against 21 individuals in which 17 were&nbsp;sentenced to death. Many of them were charged with espionage without adequate access to due process.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rather than addressing the urgent needs of Yemenis in Houthi-controlled territories, the Houthis seem to be detaining anyone they deem a threat to their movement,” said Niku Jafarnia, Yemen and Bahrain researcher at Human Rights Watch. “They should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained and shift their focus to protecting the rights and fulfilling the needs of those living in areas under their control.”<br /><br />Human Rights Watch spoke to 13 people, including relatives of the detainees, journalists, and members of civil society who have been following the cases. Human Rights Watch also reviewed documents related to the detentions, including statements made by political parties, official indictments, and lists of detainees.</p><p>The Houthis have been detaining individuals affiliated with political opposition parties since their takeover of Sanaa, Yemen’s capital, in 2014. However, they have escalated these arrests in the last few months. A spokesperson for Islah, Adnan al-Odaini, told Human Rights Watch that the campaign against their party started after Houthi forces attempted to arrest, and ultimately killed, Sheikh Saleh Hantos, a prominent sheikh in Rayma governorate, on July 1, 2025. The Houthis accused Hantos, a religious scholar in his 70s and a member of Islah, of “adopting stances aligned with the United States and Israel and undermining popular and official activities supporting the Palestinian resistance.”&nbsp;</p><p>On August 3, Houthi authorities detained&nbsp;Rami Abdulwahab, an official of the Arab Socialist Baath Party. On August 20, the Houthis detained&nbsp;Ghazi al-Ahwal, the secretary general of the General People’s Congress, the political party affiliated with former&nbsp;President Ali Abdullah Saleh. On September 25, they detained&nbsp;Aaidh al-Sayadi, deputy secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party in Dhamar governorate.<br /><br />Relatives of Abdulwahab and al-Sayadi said that the two men have not been allowed family visits or permitted to appoint lawyers to represent them.<br /><br />The October 28 detentions in Dhamar brought the total number of Islah party members held to over 200, the party said in a&nbsp;statement. Most of those recently detained were not party officials, but government employees, teachers, and social figures, said Najeeb al-Sheghdari, secretary general of the&nbsp;Musawah Organization for Human Rights and Freedoms.&nbsp;</p><p>A son of one of the Islah party detainees told Human Rights Watch that his father was taken from his car by armed masked men in Dhamar in November. He and the families of six other detainees said that the Houthis did not present arrest warrants or communicate where they were taking their relatives. The families do not know the charges against their relatives or their locations and have not been able to communicate with them, which amounts to enforced disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch has previously documented cases of Houthis detaining and forcibly disappearing dozens of people due to their political affiliation, including in April 2020, when they detained 25 Islah party members from Dhamar.&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2024, the Specialized Criminal Court sentenced 44 people detained in 2020 to death, 16 of them tried in absentia, with 5 others sentenced to prison terms,&nbsp;Musawah reported. None had adequate access to lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>The relative of one of the individuals sentenced to death said that the family had tried to appoint Abdulmajeed Sabra, a prominent lawyer in Sanaa, to his case, but that the judge “refused to give Sabra a copy of the case file and didn’t allow him to speak and kept asking him to be silent, and when Sabra objected, the judge ordered him to leave the court.” On September 25, 2025, the Houthis&nbsp;stormedSabra’s office in Sanaa and took him to an undisclosed location.&nbsp;</p><p>In their 2025&nbsp;report, the UN Panel of Experts on Yemen stated that “The [Houthis’] Judiciary has been weaponized to suppress dissent and free expression.” They further stated that “[t]he Specialized Criminal Prosecution Office in Sana’a has charged hundreds of individuals with treason and espionage.” They said that “detainees are often not shown arrest warrants, not presented with formal charges, and denied legal counsel and access to evidence. Many are held for prolonged periods without trial or judicial oversight.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch and other groups, including the former UN Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, have documented the Houthis’ use of torture to obtain information or confessions.</p><p>Arresting a person without a warrant and clear charges is a violation under the Yemeni Criminal Procedures Law, article 132. Interrogating an individual accused of a crime without the presence of their lawyer is a violation of article 181. The law also provides, under article 6, that “any statement proven to have been made by an accused or a witness under the influence of any such acts [torture, inhumane treatment, physical or psychological harm] shall be nullified and disregarded.” Detaining a person without a legal basis or, in criminal proceedings, without promptly charging them is a violation of both Yemeni law and international human rights law.</p><p>“The Houthis should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained solely for their political affiliations,” Jafarnia said. They should also free others arbitrarily detained, including those held for commemorating the&nbsp;September 26 revolution, journalists, lawyers, and&nbsp;dozens of United Nations and civil society staff.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/27/yemen-houthis-widespread-detentions-of-political-opponents,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:23.536952+00:00

<p>(Bangkok) – Thai authorities should drop criminal defamation charges against the Australian journalist Murray Hunter, who is being prosecuted for reporting on Malaysia’s media regulating agency, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Thai authorities arrested Hunter on September 29, 2025, at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport while he was awaiting to board a flight to Hong Kong. He was charged with four counts of “defamation by publication,” section 328 of Thailand’s criminal code, for defaming the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission. Each charge carries a maximum prison term of two years and a fine of up to 200,000 baht (US$6,175). He was detained for 24 hours, then released on bail. Thai authorities have confiscated his passport to prevent him from leaving the country.</p><p>“The arrest and criminal defamation charges against Murray Hunter is an alarming example of cross border efforts to suppress critical voices and media freedoms,” said Daniela Gavshon, Australia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Thai authorities should immediately drop the charges against him.”</p><p>On November 17, the Thai public prosecutor formally indicted Hunter for criminal defamation in connection with four articles he published on his Substack newsletter in April 2024 that were highly critical of the Malaysian commission. Thai authorities acted on a complaint filed by the commission’s legal representative in Thailand. Hunter’s trial is scheduled for December 22 at the Bangkok South Criminal Court.</p><p>The Malaysian government severely restricts freedom of expression, using&nbsp;broad and vaguely worded laws to target critics. In December 2024, the Malaysian parliament approved regressive amendments to the repressive Communications and Multimedia Act 1998. The regulatory Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, overseen by the Ministry of Communications and Digital, has on numerous occasions banned access to online news portals to censor critical speech. However, filing a criminal complaint against Hunter in Thailand is a new development in the Malaysian government’s efforts to curtail free speech, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>International human rights law allows for restrictions on freedom of expression to protect an individual’s reputation so long as such restrictions are necessary and narrowly drawn. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has&nbsp;said that governments should consider decriminalizing defamation and that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty” for defamation. Human Rights Watch considers criminal defamation laws incompatible with the obligation to protect freedom of expression.</p><p>The Hunter case underscores the Thai government’s willingness to violate free expression rights on behalf of foreign governments that are targeting critics beyond their borders, Human Rights Watch said.

<p>United Nations human rights experts have highlighted “widespread and systematic” exploitation, deception, and deepening debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.</p><p>Over&nbsp;800,000 Bangladeshis have Malaysian work permits, making them the largest group of documented foreign workers in the country. According to information received by the UN, thousands of workers are stranded in Bangladesh or face exploitation in Malaysia after some paid recruitment fees five times higher than the official rate.</p><p>Other abuses, including confiscation of passports by Malaysian employers, false job promises, discrepancies between contracts and promised employment packages, and a lack of support from responsible government agencies, are common in Malaysia.</p><p>Workers without proper documentation are at risk of arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and deportation under Malaysia’s&nbsp;draconian immigration act, which criminalizes irregular entry, and other anti-migrant policies. Malaysian authorities conduct frequent immigration raids and hold an estimated 18,000 migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in immigration detention centers.</p><p>The United States has previously issued import restrictions against Malaysian factories. Meanwhile the European Union’s Forced Labour Regulation, taking effect in 2027, introduces curbs on the trade of goods produced with forced labor. Debt bondage and deception of workers could lead to prohibitions on the sale of sanctioned goods under the new regulation.</p><p>The Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments, as well as those of other labor-sending or receiving countries and those where buying companies are headquartered such as the US, EU members, and the United Kingdom, have obligations to ensure labor migration is conducted in a way that protects workers’ rights. Malaysia and labor-sending governments like Bangladesh should implement the UN experts’ call to promptly investigate reported abuses and provide effective remedies. The experts emphasized that “involuntary repatriations and any form of reprisals” against migrant workers violate international human rights obligations.</p><p>International buyers sourcing from Malaysia should use the Fair Labor Association’s&nbsp;Guidance for Responsible Recruitment for companies as a model. The guidance urges buyers to “include costs of responsible recruitment in their purchasing metrics” and ensure that their suppliers include those costs in their invoicing. Buyers should also support migrant workers’ access to legal aid.</p><p>Bangladesh and Malaysia should end mistreatment of migrant workers. All governments whose economies benefit from migrant workers’ labor should avoid the risk of further sanctions by taking steps to end practices that cause misery to thousands.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/26/rampant-labor-abuses-against-bangladeshi-migrant-workers-in-malaysia,0,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:24.916925+00:00

<p>As coastal communities around the world are already facing the sobering consequences of sea level rise, government negotiators at the just-completed United Nations climate summit, known as COP30, debated a critical question: how do we measure “successful” climate adaptation?</p><p>There is no easy answer, as negotiations on how to measure progress toward a global goal on how to help communities adapt showed. But having indicators to measure adaptation matters because what is measured gets funded and prioritized by government policies and international donors.</p><p>At COP30, negotiators adopted a set of tools to measure adaptation progress, known as the Belém Adaptation Indicators, which contain problematic provisions. What countries finally adopted would, in part, measure success as the proportion of communities and number of people moved away from climate change impacts.</p><p>But evidence shows that relocating more communities is not necessarily a desired outcome. Human Rights Watch has documented how difficult planned relocation can be, even when communities request it, and how essential it is for human rights to be respected at all stages of the process. Planned relocation should be seen as a measure of last resort, only after all efforts to adapt in place are exhausted.</p><p>Moreover, if community views are not centered, new sites often offer a worse standard of living than places of origin, with challenges for relocated people’s livelihoods, access to basic services, and even ongoing exposure to new hazards (flooding in Senegal, landslides in Panama, ongoing sea level rise in Solomon Islands). Adaptation “success” should measure relocated people’s quality of life and whether their rights are protected after the planned relocation, not whether they move.</p><p>Adaptation “success” depends not on the number of relocations but on the quality of governance and support for relocating communities. An earlier draft of the indicators would have instead measured the number of protocols on planned relocation developed to ensure that communities are properly supported and moves are “safe, voluntary and dignified.” Measuring adaptation success as policy development aligns with the goal of a coalition of relocating community leaders and their allies, launched by Human Rights Watch in June 2025. Ultimately, adaptation progress and protection of human rights must go hand in hand.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/26/cop30-measures-of-climate-adaptation-progress-should-center-rights,2,-0.2256361,52.3229901,2025-11-29T21:41:26.458737+00:00

<p>As families across the United States prepare to gather for Thanksgiving this Thursday, too many children face danger cultivating and harvesting the foods that will end up on our tables.</p><p>A new Los Angeles Times&nbsp;investigation has found children working back-breaking 10-hour shifts on farms across the US state of California. Many said they began working when they were between 11 and 13 years old.</p><p>The children’s stories are eerily familiar. My colleagues and I have&nbsp;interviewed hundreds of children working on&nbsp;US farms who also worked 10 or more hours a day in extreme heat and reported injuries, illness, and chronic pain.</p><p>Many children we spoke with were exposed to toxic&nbsp;pesticides while they worked, with some becoming violently ill afterward. “I got so sick one time after they sprayed,” a 15-year-old girl told me. “I got really dizzy and I saw black. I sat down and threw up several times.” Pesticide exposure can be especially harmful to children because their bodies and brains are still developing.</p><p>US labor law leaves child farmworkers&nbsp;unprotected from these dangers. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, children as young as 12 can work unlimited hours on farms of any size with parental permission, as long as they do not miss school. At 16, child farmworkers can do work considered hazardous, while in all other sectors, workers must be 18 to do hazardous work. Enforcement of even these weak protections is often lacking.</p><p>A bill before Congress would close these gaps and provide child farmworkers with the same protections as other working children. Last week, Congressman Raul Ruiz of California reintroduced the Children’s Act for Responsible Employment and Farm Safety (CARE Act), which would raise the minimum working age in agriculture from 12 to 14, and prohibit those under 18 from performing hazardous work.</p><p>Child labor in the US —and worldwide —is driven by economic need, and ensuring living wages, social security, labor rights protections, and free education are all key to&nbsp;protecting children from hazardous child labor. But strong legal frameworks and robust labor enforcement, coupled with other human rights protections, can help eliminate child labor.</p><p>For Thanksgiving, members of Congress should support the CARE Act and use their power to protect child farmworkers.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/26/us-congress-should-protect-child-workers-harvesting-crops,2,-112.850737,34.162526,2025-11-29T21:41:27.899045+00:00

<p>Azerbaijani authorities are escalating their campaign against independent and critical voices abroad, issuing arrest warrants and summonses for exiled journalists, activists, and analysts on what appear to be politically motivated charges. The moves fit a long-running pattern of efforts&nbsp; to crush dissent and restrict freedom of expression both inside Azerbaijan and beyond its borders. &nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in November, the Prosecutor General’s Office announced that the Binagadi District Court had issued arrest warrants in absentia for several exiled figures charged under multiple articles of Azerbaijan’s criminal code. Those targeted include Osmangizi, Ganimat Zahid, and Beydulla Manafov, journalists; Abid Gafarov, a blogger; Altay Goyushov, a historian; Arastun Oruclu, a political analyst; and Vagif Allahverdiyev, founder of the YouTube channel Victor Alexander.</p><p>Osmangizi, Gafarov, Oruclu, Allahverdiyev, and Goyushov are being investigated under criminal code articles 220.2 and 281.2 for “calls for mass disorder” and “public calls against the state,” offences which authorities frequently misuse to criminalize lawful exercise of freedoms of expression and assembly. Manafov faces the same “anti-state” accusation under article 281.2, along with an additional charge under article 283.1 for “inciting national, racial, social, or religious hatred.”</p><p>The alleged factual basis for these criminal investigations remains unclear, though it is evident that all those targeted are outspoken critics of the Azerbaijani government’s human rights failings and regularly voice their concerns online.</p><p>These cases reflect the authorities’ longstanding practice of abusing the criminal justice system to silence critics, which Human Rights Watch has extensively documented over many years.</p><p>Since November 2023, Azerbaijani authorities have arrested&nbsp;journalists,&nbsp;political activists,&nbsp;rights defenders, and scholars on&nbsp;spurious financial and other criminal charges, including illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion, and document forgery.</p><p>The latest wave of targeting Azerbaijanis abroad follows multiple criminal investigations in March 2025 against several exiled bloggers, accusing them of offenses including fraud, terrorism, inciting riots, disobeying official orders, and attempting a coup. Since then, the courts have issued numerous arrest warrants and handed down convictions in absentia. Most recently, in September, a court sentenced a France-based blogger, Mahammad Mirzali, in absentia to six and a half years in prison on several charges, including inciting mass unrest.</p><p>Azerbaijani authorities should immediately drop all politically motivated charges, end their&nbsp;relentless crackdown on independent voices at home and abroad, and uphold their international obligations to respect free expression and association.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/26/azerbaijan-escalates-crackdown-on-exiled-critics,2,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:27.899335+00:00

<p>The United Nations leadership has launched a major reform plan to make the cash-strapped world body more efficient and cost-effective. Unfortunately, it has offered little on how this will impact the UN’s already understaffed and underfunded human rights work and the victims it is intended to help.</p><p>The UN’s worsening financial crisis is largely due to the failure of some member states, including the United States and China, to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. The Trump administration, which has gutted its foreign aid program budget, has halted most of its obligatory payments to the UN, while China has been paying extremely late.</p><p>Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ “UN80” reform initiative, named to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the UN’s founding this year, is intended to address this liquidity crisis, but its impact will be severe. The package’s proposed 2026 budget calls for an average of 15 percent reductions in expenditures, including nearly 20 percent in staff cuts.</p><p>The UN secretariat has suggested one of its problems is that it has too many mandates, including on human rights. In a September 2025 report to the UN General Assembly, Guterres referred to the “proliferation of mechanisms” related to human rights, which he said has led to “fragmentation, duplication and competition for resources.”</p><p>UN member states create human rights mechanisms in response to crises. In the face of widespread atrocities in Sudan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Myanmar, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, and elsewhere, for example, independent UN investigations were established to document abuses and support accountability. Many of these investigations are already struggling to function with shoestring staffs and a fraction of their budgeted funding.</p><p>For years, Russia, China, Iran and other governments with poor human rights records have also sought to defund UN human rights mechanisms in the General Assembly’s Fifth Committee, which is currently discussing the 2026 budget.</p><p>Cutting or merging crucial human rights mandates won’t solve the UN’s liquidity crisis—human rights accounts for less than 1 percent of total UN expenditures. But it will hurt victims of abuse by signaling to those responsible that scrutiny is being cut back. The UN leadership and its member states cannot let the opponents of human rights win.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/26/un-should-protect-its-long-underfunded-human-rights-pillar,0,105.3188,61.524,2025-11-29T21:41:27.899686+00:00

The Cambodian government is not supporting hundreds of thousands of migrant workers with microfinance debts who returned from Thailand because of hostilities in mid-2025.The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure an adequate standard of living, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans, making the tenuous situation of people who returned even more difficult.The government should follow through on its pledges to find jobs for those who returned and implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians from predatory debt collection practices.<p>(Bangkok) – The&nbsp;Cambodian government is failing to provide support to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers with microfinance debts who returned from&nbsp;Thailand because of hostilities in mid-2025,&nbsp;Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Even before the border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, from July 24-28, Cambodian officials&nbsp;encouraged migrant workers in Thailand to return home because of rising tensions, and more than&nbsp;900,000 have done so. The government’s promises of jobs and other support have not materialized for most though, and many are under pressure to repay microfinance loans they took before seeking work in Thailand. The government should assist returned migrant workers to find jobs in Cambodia and adopt measures to provide meaningful debt relief to them and other Cambodians.</p><p>“The Cambodian government has an obligation to assist the migrant workers its officials encouraged to return from Thailand because of discrimination and recent hostilities,” said&nbsp;Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should ensure that predatory microfinance institutions are not putting improper pressure on returned migrants and other marginalized Cambodians who are struggling to feed their families.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 56 former migrant workers in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province who returned from Thailand between May and September.</p><p>The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure the rights to an adequate standard of living, education, and health care, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans. The return of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers because of hostilities with Thailand and the promises of support from the Cambodian government have made their already tenuous situation even more difficult, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>In May, tensions&nbsp;escalated at the Thai-Cambodia border. On June 14, Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen&nbsp;called on all Cambodians working in Thailand to return home to avoid expulsion or mistreatment in Thailand, calling it a “real and inevitable risk.” Prime Minister Hun Manet, Hun Sen’s son, said the government was prepared to facilitate repatriation, with the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training pledging more than 70,000 jobs for returned migrants and the Ministry of Economy and Finance ready to offer a “range of economic and social intervention packages aimed at improving their daily lives.”</p><p>On June 23, Thailand&nbsp;ordered the closure of all land crossings with Cambodia, except for migrant workers returning to Cambodia.</p><p>Migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia due to discrimination and harassment in Thailand, as well as the Cambodian government’s promises of employment and social assistance. But many said that once back in Cambodia, they have been skipping meals and forgoing medical care to make repayments on microfinance loans they incurred before going abroad. In 2023, the average Cambodian household held&nbsp;more debt than they spent for the year.</p><p>A 17-year-old who had worked for two years in Thailand said she had dropped out of school and migrated to help her mother repay a microfinance loan. She said that after fighting between Thailand and Cambodia began, her Thai employers would regularly verbally harass her: “I would cry every day because of the bad treatment at work.”</p><p>Despite government promises, returned migrant workers said that there were very few jobs available once they got back home. Some travelled to find work in the capital, Phnom Penh, hundreds of kilometers away from their homes in provinces along the Thai-Cambodia border, but few reportedly found employment.</p><p>A 32-year-old woman who tried to get a job at a Cambodian garment factory after returning from Thailand said she did not have the necessary experience. “I took a three-day skills test, and I didn’t pass because I didn’t have the skills to work and sew the garments,” she said. “They want skilled workers, and we don’t have the skills.”</p><p>Many returned migrants have loans from banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). For years, Cambodian banks and MFIs have engaged in predatory lending, causing a household debt crisis, and pressure to repay debts&nbsp;often contributes to the decision to migrate to Thailand for work. Cambodia has the most&nbsp;microcredit debt per capita anywhere in the world.</p><p>A 2019&nbsp;report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) identified microfinance debt as a growing driver of migration from Cambodia, and Cambodia’s microfinance sector has grown rapidly since then. The&nbsp;Cambodian Development Resource Institute (CDRI) reported that one-third of returned migrant workers are from households that hold formal loans ranging from US$5,000 to US$8,000, several times larger than Cambodia’s annual median per-capita income.</p><p>A 41-year-old woman who had lived in Thailand for 10 years working in construction in Bangkok said that she now had to balance repaying her loans with paying for health care and&nbsp;her&nbsp;children’s education. “We have to decide between food, making MFI payments, and whether our kids can still afford to go to school,” she said. Her household used to have three people working in Thailand but now all have returned, and the family has cut back to two meals a day. She said that if they miss their monthly loan repayment of more than $100, they will lose the land they pledged as collateral for the loan.</p><p>Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Cambodia is a party, governments are obligated to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to progressively realize the human right to an adequate standard of living. This includes the obligation to protect people from conduct by third parties, such as predatory microfinance institutions, that would prevent the fulfillment of this right. Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, private companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for practices that have harmed people.</p><p>The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing.</p><p>This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.</p><p>The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education. The Cambodian government should allocate appropriate resources to both sectors and set budgetary spending targets aligned with international benchmarks.</p><p>“The situation is dire for these returned migrant workers, who are rapidly eroding their savings to survive and pay off their debts,” Lau said. “Cambodian authorities need to act swiftly to protect Cambodians from microfinance lenders and financial institutions and support workers who returned from Thailand at their urging.”</p><p>Fear of Violence, Discrimination Drove Migrant Workers to Return</p><p>Many migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia because they experienced or feared discrimination in Thailand, or feared violence, as tensions rose at the border.</p><p>A woman, 44, who had worked in Thailand for more than 20 years, said that after the border conflict began on July 24, everyday life in Thailand became more difficult. She recalled being told, “Why don’t you go back to Cambodia and pick up the bones of the dead Cambodians?”</p><p>“My husband and I could not handle the discrimination, so we returned,” she said. “People in the market didn’t want to sell us food because we are Cambodian. Every time we went to work, we felt this discrimination.”&nbsp;</p><p>A man, 30, who had worked in Thailand for 10 years reported witnessing violence against Cambodian migrant workers. “A group of Thai men, around 50, were on foot and motorbikes looking for Khmer to attack,” he said. “One of the people in my village was also beaten and chased [until] I was about 10 meters away. The couple wanted help but there were so many Thais beating them, no one dared to help.”</p><p>Thai media&nbsp;reported several assaults on Cambodian workers, as well as social media posts of a Thai ultra-royalist activist talking about Cambodian workers who were ungrateful and taking jobs from Thai citizens.</p><p>Returned migrants said that Thai police and authorities also discriminated against Cambodian workers. A woman, 37, who worked in construction in Bangkok said that Thai police would ask migrant workers, “Do you want to go home to Cambodia, or do you all want to go to prison together?”</p><p>A man, 18, who also worked in construction in the Thai capital, recalled Thai police going door-to-door to check visas and passports of Cambodian migrant workers, asking for money or detaining people who could not pay. Some migrant workers reported being required to pay bribes to Thai police or soldiers when they crossed back into Cambodia.</p><p>The border between Cambodia and Thailand has remained shut, and many workers fear a return to Thailand would mean further discrimination or even violence from Thai authorities or employers. Thai media&nbsp;reported that about 300 Cambodian migrant workers were arrested between mid-June and September for attempting to cross into Thailand without permission. Other Cambodian migrant workers have reported&nbsp;staying in Thailand despite the situation due to the economic pressures stemming from loans, including bank and microfinance loans from Cambodian financial institutions.</p><p>After border tensions again&nbsp;increased in early November, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on November 10&nbsp;announced the suspension of a policy that allows about 100,000 migrant workers from Cambodia to stay in Thailand for an additional year after their work permits expire. This has left the legal status of Cambodian migrant workers remaining in Thailand in limbo.</p><p>Promises of Jobs Unmet</p><p>Some migrant workers said that Cambodian government promises of jobs and social assistance also encouraged them to return home. On June 14, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet&nbsp;posted on his Facebook page that the government was ready to handle a mass repatriation of workers, and specifically mentioned that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training would help find jobs for returned migrants due to a shortage of tens of thousands of workers in the country.</p><p>Upon returning to Cambodia, many migrants found that there were few jobs available, and those that did exist were either too far from their homes or a poor match for their skills. A woman, 53, returned to Cambodia due to fears of violence and because she read news reports that the Cambodian government had jobs for returning migrant workers. “But when we returned, there were no jobs for us,” she said.</p><p>A man, 28, said that getting hired at a garment factory in Cambodia was difficult because the jobs were far away, and returned migrant workers often lacked any connections that could help them secure employment. Others reported that the costs of transportation and housing in Phnom Penh and the length of time it would most likely take to find a job would make it too expensive for many returned migrants to seek employment in the capital.</p><p>The CDRI&nbsp;reported that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training claimed there were 190,000 jobs available for returned migrant workers. Even if true, with more than 900,000 migrant workers returning, more than 700,000 workers would not be covered.</p><p>The CDRI further noted a mismatch between the available jobs and returned workers, with the majority of migrants returning to border provinces, such as Banteay Meanchey and Battambang, while most of the available jobs were in Phnom Penh. In addition, more than half of returned migrant workers had been working in construction or agriculture in Thailand, while most of the available jobs in Cambodia were in other sectors.</p><p>In October, a group of local civil society organizations&nbsp;called on the government to address these issues through improved social security, especially unemployment benefits, large-scale and gender-sensitive employment programs, and debt relief, among other measures.</p><p>International human rights law provides everyone the right to social security, including during periods of unemployment. Currently, nobody who is unemployed in Cambodia has access to social security, based on the International Labour Organization’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>Debt Pressures</p><p>As Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;previously reported, Cambodian households often take out loans from paying supplementary school fees to affording out-of-pocket payments for essential medicines, and other human rights. But when household income must be diverted to service debt, it can also limit the fulfillment of rights like health, education, and an adequate standard of living, which includes the rights to food, housing, and water.</p><p>Like other Cambodians living in rural areas or in poverty, many returned migrant workers are in significant debt to microfinance institutions for loans they took out years ago.</p>

<p>While the Cambodian government has adopted laws and policies to regulate MFIs, they remain largely unenforced, allowing predatory lending and collection practices to persist.</p><p>In correspondence with Human Rights Watch from July, the National Bank of Cambodia, which has the authority to sanction and suspend or revoke licenses of MFIs, did not provide any instances in which it had penalized or sanctioned MFIs for any violation of consumer protection or regulatory laws or policies. Rather, the government has repeatedly demonstrated a&nbsp;preference for voluntary measures and self-regulation.</p><p>On July 30, the National Bank of Cambodia issued new&nbsp;guidelines to financial institutions that “encouraged” them to enact unspecified “relief” for returned migrant workers. None of the people interviewed identified any meaningful relief measures by microfinance institutions or banks.</p><p>A woman, 18, who was until recently working at an agricultural factory in Thailand said she moved abroad after dropping out of school in grade 9 because her family had to sell the motorbike that she was using to ride to school to repay their microfinance loans. She said that since returning to Cambodia in July, she eats about half as much meat as she used to at each meal and is worried about not being able to pay for treatment for her mother’s medical condition.</p><p>A woman, 35, who used to work on a farm in Thailand before the fighting began, took a microfinance loan to build a home, but now struggles to juggle repayments along with food and medical costs. “I have to cut down on my food a lot ... we are replacing meat and protein with more rice now,” she said. “Credit officers come to my home to pressure me to make payments.… I am afraid they will take my land. We are afraid of the MFIs more than we are of the police.”</p><p>A woman, 47, who has both microfinance debt and informal loans, expressed fears about repaying her debts: “I’m willing to go without eating to pay back my loans out of fear of losing my land that my home is on.”</p><p>These pressures have led returned migrant workers to take on more debt to make ends meet and avoid forced land sales, a&nbsp;common practice of credit officers who pressure borrowers to sell their land without using the legal foreclosure method when they are unable to repay their loans. A man, 55, with a microfinance loan who had pledged his land as collateral, said: “When I am late on repayments, I walk around my village looking to borrow money from people out of fear of losing my land and my home on it ... I worry every day about my microfinance loan repayments; I worry all the time. Whatever I have I will sell, because I am worried about them taking my land.”</p><p>Healthcare costs put over-indebted households under further financial strain, with 61 percent of all healthcare costs in Cambodia covered out-of-pocket, by far the&nbsp;highest percentage in the region and among the highest in the world.</p><p>A woman, 33, who had recently returned after working in Thailand for four years, said that she initially left Cambodia because she could not earn enough to repay a microfinance loan, which she needed partly to pay for treating her mother’s chronic illness.</p><p>“When we are late, credit officers will come and harass us to make payments, and we would avoid staying home to not have them pressure us,” she said. “There have been maybe three or four families in my village who have lost land because they didn’t pay MFI loans. The families who lost land had to go work in Thailand, but now we don’t know where they are, because they have nothing to come back to.”</p><p>Two former construction workers in Bangkok—a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman—had each taken out microfinance loans to cover healthcare expenses for family members, using land that their houses are on as collateral. They said they ate less than they did before returning from Thailand because they were worried about losing their land. “I repay because I’m worried that they [credit officers] will take my land away,” the woman said. “I see on Facebook that people have lost their land, so I stress about it.”</p><p>The Cambodian Government’s Inadequate Response</p><p>There are few options available for returned migrant workers who cannot find work and are burdened with heavy microfinance debt.</p><p>The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also take additional measures to implement more effective consumer protection measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing. This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to prohibit and enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.</p><p>The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education. The Cambodian government should allocate appropriate resources to both sectors and set budgetary spending targets aligned with international benchmarks.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/25/cambodia-returned-migrant-workers-face-hunger-joblessness,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:27.900776+00:00

<p>By a Research Assistant, Middle East and North Africa Division</p><p>On November 23, Yemen’s President Rashad al-Alimi stated in a cabinet meeting that “it is unacceptable for the Yemeni government to remain without a single ministerial portfolio led by a woman in a country where women make up more than half of the population.” Al-Alimi added that women “possess the expertise and competence that make their absence a legal and institutional flaw that must be corrected.”</p><p>Yemeni Prime Minister Salem Saleh bin Buraik offered a similar sentiment in June 2025, praising “the remarkable role played by Yemeni women amid current challenges, affirming the government’s commitment to strengthening their participation in decision-making and ensuring a meaningful, effective partnership on the ground.”</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme noted in 2021 that “Yemeni women remain significantly under-represented in public and elected office holding only 4.1 per cent of managerial and decision-making positions …” Despite the repeated statements, women’s marginalization from government decision-making remains largely unchanged.</p><p>In 2020, the former Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalek formed his second cabinet without any women ministers—the same cabinet that remains in place today. Abdulmalek’s previous cabinet included only two women out of 36 ministers; since 2014 Yemeni women’s representation at the cabinet level has been strikingly low. Beyond ministerial [or cabinet] roles, women’s participation in decision-making should be actively supported in local government, private sector initiatives, and civil society.</p><p>Women in Yemen face continued challenges and risks as warring parties continue to target them. In March 2024, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting the parties’ violations and restrictions against women stating that “the restrictions have harmed women’s ability to access work, education, and health care, and are a form of discrimination.” The Yemeni authorities have failed to fully address restrictions on women’s movement, even within their own areas of control.</p><p>Yemeni women are also victims of political violence, including assassinations. On September 18, 2025, Ms. Iftihan al-Mashhari, head of the Cleaning and Improvement Fund, was assassinated in Taiz city by armed assailants.</p><p>While Human Rights Watch welcomes the recognition of women’s importance by the head of the Presidential Leadership Council, the government needs to translate this rhetoric into reality, including by expanding women’s role in decision-making at all levels of government and by addressing the mobility challenges and restrictions women face. The government, as well as the UN, should also ensure that women are adequately included in peace talks and any transitional justice efforts. Beyond simple inclusion in visible roles, the government and its partners should address the underlying structural barriers, including discrimination that women face, across all levels of society.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/25/yemeni-government-inaction-on-gender-equality-speaks-louder-than-words,2,47.8915271,16.3471243,2025-11-29T21:41:29.329107+00:00

<p>(Abuja) –&nbsp;Nigerian authorities should act urgently to secure the safe release of students and teachers recently kidnapped in the country’s northwest and take concrete steps to protect schools and communities from further attacks, Human Rights Watch said today. The groups responsible for the kidnappings should immediately release the students and teachers they are holding captive.</p><p>On November 18, 2025, 25 schoolgirls&nbsp;were kidnapped by unidentified armed men from the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi state. Just three days later, on November 21, 303 students and 12 teachers&nbsp;were kidnapped at&nbsp;St. Mary’s Catholic Primary and Secondary School in Papiri, Niger state.</p><p>“These mass school kidnappings once again lay bare the deliberate targeting of students, teachers, and schools in Nigeria’s deteriorating security environment,” said Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch.&nbsp;“The deepening crisis underscores the government’s failure to protect vulnerable communities.”</p><p>No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Nigeria has in recent years been plagued by violent attacks and kidnappings by&nbsp;criminal gangs colloquially called “bandits.” These groups have carried out kidnappings for ransom, including of schoolchildren in Nigeria’s northwestern  and central states. On November 18, the Al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, or JNIM), which is active throughout the Sahel, claimed responsibility for&nbsp;an attack on a military patrol in Kwara state on October 29, apparently its first incursion into Nigerian territory.</p><p>Human Rights Watch spoke with parents of two of the girls abducted in Kebbi state. Isa Nazifi, whose 13-year-old daughter Khadija Nazifi, a junior secondary school student, was among those abducted, said: “I immediately took a motorbike and rushed to the school, where I found my second daughter, also a student at the school. She told me Khadija had been taken. We are extremely worried. My wife is in tears. I will stay here at the school until my daughter returns. If I go home without her, what will I tell my family?”</p><p>Malam Sani Zimri, whose daughter, Salima Sani Zimri, is a senior secondary school student who was also abducted, said he had heard rumors from other parents of a possible attack by bandits the week before the incident: “We developed confidence after seeing military operatives surveilling the area, only to realize that there were no security operatives on the premises for the entire three hours that the incident occurred.”</p><p>The&nbsp;2014 Chibok schoolgirls’ abduction in Borno state by the armed Islamist group Boko Haram provoked global outrage. Since then, a series of school kidnappings across northern Nigeria has left families traumatized and entire communities living in fear that if their children went to school, they might never return home. In 2016, Human Rights Watch&nbsp;reported that Boko Haram had similarly abducted over 300 children from the Zanna Mobarti Primary School in Damasak, Borno state, in 2015.</p><p>In December 2020,&nbsp;more than 300 boys were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kankara, Katsina state. In early 2021, students were again taken in major incidents in&nbsp;Kagara, Niger state, and&nbsp;Jangebe, Zamfara state, followed by the&nbsp;kidnapping of over 100 studentsfrom Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna state. The spate of kidnappings continued in 2024 with students taken from schools&nbsp;in Kuriga, Kaduna state, and&nbsp;Gidan Bakuso, Sokoto state.</p><p>Nigerian authorities have failed to apply lessons from previous attacks to create early warning systems and other measures that could prevent these atrocities, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>In response to the recent kidnappings, the government has&nbsp;promised to rescue the kidnapped students and hold those responsible accountable. President Bola Tinubu directed security agencies to act swiftly to bring the girls back while also urging local communities to share intelligence.</p><p>The authorities&nbsp;have also shut down 47 federal secondary schools known as Federal Unity Colleges, and some states including&nbsp;Katsina,&nbsp;Taraba, and&nbsp;Niger have also closed schools or restricted school activities, particularly boarding institutions. While these measures are aimed at protecting students, they have disrupted learning for thousands of children, denying them access to education and the social and psychological support schools provide. Without concrete measures to provide alternative learning opportunities to ensure continuity in their education, the students are at risk of falling behind academically and facing long term setbacks in their development.</p><p>Nigeria is a&nbsp;signatory to the Safe Schools Declaration, committing the government to take concrete steps to protect education during conflict and insecurity. Yet kidnappings have continued at a relentless pace and scale. On November 19, the Nigerian Senate&nbsp;ordered a full-scale investigationinto the implementation of the government’s Safe School Fund, questioning why money earmarked for protecting schools has failed to prevent recurring attacks. The government should move with urgency to advance a&nbsp;proposal to introduce legislation to implement the Safe Schools Declaration, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“Children in Nigeria have the right to go to school without fearing for their lives,” Ewang said. “Nigerian authorities should prioritize the safe release of the kidnapped children and their teachers and bring those responsible for their abduction to justice.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/25/nigeria-renewed-spate-of-school-kidnappings,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:29.329521+00:00

<p>Is it safe to return to a country wracked by an abusive armed conflict, widespread atrocities, and targeted ethnic violence, including war crimes and crimes against humanity?</p><p>The Trump administration says it is. On November 24, the US&nbsp;Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued&nbsp;notice of termination of Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for people from&nbsp;Myanmar, effective January 26.</p><p>TPS status protects non-US citizens from deportation to countries facing armed conflict or other crises making return unsafe. There are almost&nbsp;4,000 people from Myanmar designated for TPS, and many may now become subject to arrest and deportation.</p><p>The notice acknowledges that Myanmar “continues to face humanitarian challenges,” but claims termination is justified due to “improvements” in “governance and stability,” including the military junta’s revocation of a state of emergency and plans for “free and fair” elections starting in December.</p><p>Extensive reporting on Myanmar contradicts almost every assertion in the notice. Myanmar’s supposedly revoked state of emergency in July was immediately replaced with a new state of emergency and martial law in scores of townships across nine states and regions. Foreign governments and United Nations officials widely understand the junta’s planned “elections” are a&nbsp;fraudulent ploy for international legitimacy.</p><p>The Homeland Security notice is directly contradicted by what other US officials openly admit: “For years… the military regime in Myanmar has carried out atrocities against its own citizens, including… appalling human rights violations and abuses,” wrote the US Mission to the UN just days ago,&nbsp;in a statement supporting a new&nbsp;UN resolution on Myanmar’s rights record. The resolution—which the US supported—specifically stated that the military’s abuses make Myanmar “unsuitable for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of all refugees and forcibly displaced persons.”</p><p>Military atrocities and attacks on civilians in Myanmar&nbsp;have not diminished and are documented daily in&nbsp;numerous UN investigations and&nbsp;guidance papers and outlined in reporting by the&nbsp;US State Department and&nbsp;other governments,&nbsp;media, and&nbsp;human rights&nbsp;groups. Extensive abuses have also been acknowledged in&nbsp;recent statements by congressional leaders from both parties.&nbsp;The UN has reported thousands of civilians killed by the military this year and the ongoing displacement of over 3.5 million people.</p><p>Homeland Security’s misstatements in revoking TPS for people from Myanmar are so egregious that it is hard to imagine who would believe them. Perhaps no one was expected to.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/24/myanmar-is-safe,6,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-11-29T21:41:29.329707+00:00

<p>The US State Department’s annual human rights report was created to give Congress a clear accounting of how other governments treat their people, measured against international human rights law. Recent media reports indicate that the Trump administration is turning that purpose on its head by mandating reporting in support of ideological priorities at odds with governments’ human rights obligations.</p><p>The 2024 version of the State Department report issued by the Trump administration in August already&nbsp;removed or significantly reduced sections on political freedoms, corruption, gender-based violence, and LGBTQ+ persecution. New&nbsp;guidance sent in November to US embassy personnel worldwide looks set to do even more damage.</p><p>According to the Washington Post, embassies will be instructed to document whether governments are implementing various policies the Trump administration opposes as though they were human rights violations. In reality, though, many of these targeted policies are important efforts to support and improve respect for human rights. These include government policies to improve access to abortion services and gender-affirming care, as well as efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. &nbsp;</p><p>These changes would translate parts of the administration’s rights-abusing domestic policy agenda into US foreign policy. &nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t just about political slogans or ideological debates. US diplomatic pressure around these issues can influence whether people can exercise their rights, access essential services, and live with dignity. In many countries, restrictions on reproductive health care violate the rights of women and girls, while others on evidence-based gender-affirming&nbsp;careviolate the rights of transgender people, and&nbsp;attacks on inclusivity policies undermine the rights of marginalized people. &nbsp;</p><p>As the US government turns against key facets of international human rights protection, other governments should step forward. The stakes are high: when a country with global reach like the US warps its idea of rights to fit with a political agenda that undermines them, it risks weakening protections for people in every part of the world.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/24/us-state-department-debases-human-rights-diplomacy,4,-71.0577716,42.3588043,2025-11-29T21:41:30.902398+00:00

<p>In Belem, Brazil, as the United Nations climate summit (COP30) convened, I marched alongside&nbsp;thousands of activists and Indigenous peoples calling on governments to urgently address climate change and protect human rights.</p><p>As previous host countries restricted such demonstrations, the November 15 march was exhilarating. However, despite clear—and powerful—calls from civil society for the summit to take bolder steps on climate change and to uphold human rights, COP30 failed to make progress on two key issues: fossil fuels and deforestation.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has researched how&nbsp;communities near coal, oil, and gas sites face severe harms, and how Indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities&nbsp;continue to face violence and land grabs. Ahead of the summit, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&nbsp;urged countries to agree on “roadmaps” to transition away from fossil fuels and to end the deforestation that has been disastrous for the country’s Indigenous communities. During negotiations,&nbsp;more than 80 countries—led by Colombia and supported by climate-vulnerable states—pushed for a roadmap on fossil fuels to be reflected in the final negotiated text.&nbsp;</p><p>But this momentum was opposed by producer countries including India, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and the&nbsp;final text does not mention fossil fuels and avoids any concrete commitments or deadlines towards a phaseout. Similarly, the COP30 final text omitted a deforestation roadmap or binding commitments to protect forests, falling short of scientific evidence and the demands of frontline communities.</p><p>The most promising initiatives now appear outside of the formal COP process. While details remain limited, the Brazilian presidency announced the creation of two roadmaps: one for phasing out fossil fuels and another on ending deforestation. The next concrete step on the phaseout of fossil fuels is a&nbsp;conference to be co-hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands in April 2026.Within the COP30 process, countries agreed to establish a mechanism on the just transition, committed to tripling adaptation finance by 2035, and took the unprecedented step of recognizing&nbsp;“the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as their land rights and traditional knowledge” in the final COP30 decision.&nbsp;</p><p>But for a summit intended to advance global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, the failure to make any tangible progress on fossil fuels and deforestation means COP30 fell far short of what is needed to protect people and the planet.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/24/cop30-fails-to-confront-drivers-of-climate-crisis,2,-74.2973,4.5709,2025-11-29T21:41:30.902705+00:00

<p>A new&nbsp;quantitative study from&nbsp;National Observatory on Violence Against Educators represents one of the most comprehensive efforts to date to measure the nature and scale of&nbsp;censorship and harassment of educators across Brazil.</p><p>While previous analyses have documented the legal and political tactics to undermine or prohibit human rights education, this new report offers a nationally representative dataset showing the problem’s breadth: in every region of the country, at least 90 percent of educators reported directly experiencing or indirectly hearing of acts of censorship or harassment.</p><p>The research draws on 3,012 responses collected through an online survey between May and September 2024 from educators in all regions and across levels of education. The sample was weighted using&nbsp;official employment data to approximate the regional distribution of the national education workforce. Most respondents (~70 percent) worked in basic education, and 88 percent were employed in public schools.</p><p>Nearly half of respondents said that, since 2010, they have experienced four or more incidents restricting their pedagogical autonomy, including school officials, parents, and political figures intimidating or prohibiting them from teaching topics protected under Brazilian and international human rights law.</p><p>Themes commonly targeted include questions of gender and sexuality, categories deliberately reframed by extremist actors as taboo or illegitimate in the classroom. These findings align with the patterns of gender- and sexuality-related harassment Human Rights Watch documented in a&nbsp;2022 report, where misinformation was weaponized to curtail educators’ teaching of this content.</p><p>Among those who reported being directly targeted, 76 percent reported significant negative impacts on their work, while 67 percent reported impacts on their personal lives, including stress, self-censorship, and, in some cases, removal from duties by school authorities or physical aggression by students’ families, other educators, or students, among others. Even educators who only heard of attacks second-hand reported fear and self-silencing, pointing to the collective negative impact of harassment and censorship.</p><p>The report identifies spikes in censorship during electoral years, particularly 2018 and 2022, suggesting that schools have become political battlegrounds, with heightened persecution correlating with moments of intensified polarization. These findings should raise alarms for policymakers and civil society as Brazil approaches future electoral cycles.</p><p>The study provides essential empirical grounding for understanding the scale and systemic nature of attacks on educational freedom in Brazil. The federal government and local education departments should support educators to ensure that they feel confident and protected when teaching human rights content.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/24/new-data-on-censorship-and-harassment-of-brazils-educators,2,-51.9253,-14.235,2025-11-29T21:41:30.902958+00:00

<p>(Washington, DC) – Escalating political pressure on electoral authorities threatens&nbsp;Hondurans’ right to vote in free and fair elections, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Honduras will hold general elections on November 30, 2025, for the president, all 128 National Congress members, and 20 Central American Parliament members. In recent weeks, the Attorney General’s Office has opened criminal investigations targeting top electoral authorities. Meanwhile, deadlock within the National Electoral Council (CNE) has repeatedly&nbsp;delayed awarding contracts to organize the election. Allegations of fraud leveled by&nbsp;President Xiomara Castro, as well as members of&nbsp;opposition parties, also undermine the credibility of the electoral process.</p><p>“Allegations of possible fraud, aggressive moves by both prosecutors and the army, and political deadlock in the electoral authority are threatening Hondurans’ right to participate in free and fair elections,” said&nbsp;Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “International election observation missions should closely monitor the process and press Honduran authorities to ensure that election conditions are free and fair.”</p><p>Since 2019, the electoral authority has been split between the Electoral Justice Tribunal (TJE), the highest authority on matters of electoral justice, and the CNE, which administers the electoral process. Both institutions are composed of three principal members, elected by a two-thirds vote in Congress. The appointments of members to the council and the tribunal stemmed from a political agreement among the Nacional, Liberal, and Libre parties, the largest in the country, with each securing one seat on each body. In recent months, tensions among the council members have&nbsp;paralyzed the CNE.</p><p>On October 29, Attorney General Johel Zelaya announced an investigation into Cossette López, the council member from the Nacional party, accusing her of plotting to manipulate the electoral results. Zelaya cited an audio recording, which López&nbsp;says was manipulated. President Castro&nbsp;described the disputed recordings as part of a “criminal conspiracy aimed at provoking an electoral coup.”</p><p>On November 10, prosecutors opened an&nbsp;investigation against two judges from the tribunal, alleging that they acted unlawfully by&nbsp;approving a resolution with just two of the three judges present.</p><p>On November 9, the council tested its nationwide system to transmit&nbsp;preliminary election results on election night. Councilor Marlon Ochoa from the Libre Party&nbsp;said the test had failed and that “there is a conspiracy against the electoral process from within the electoral body itself.”</p><p>The armed forces joint chiefs of staff chairman&nbsp;asked the council to provide the army with a copy of the presidential vote tally sheet on election day. Ana Paola Hall, the council president,&nbsp;said she rejected this request. The army has the&nbsp;constitutional duty to support the transportation of electoral materials on election day, but does not have any authority to access, count, transmit, or review the results.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 20, the armed forces filed a complaint before the Attorney General’s Office seeking to initiate a criminal action for defamation against López.</p><p>In this context of growing distrust and allegations of fraud, the role of independent domestic and international election observation missions will be critical to preserving the credibility of the process, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The Organization of American States observation mission has expressed&nbsp;concern about “frequent actions and statements—practically on a daily basis—that generate uncertainty and destabilize the electoral process” and&nbsp;raised concerns about “excessive judicial intervention” in the elections. The European Union has also&nbsp;deployed an election observation mission to Honduras.&nbsp;On November 18, the EU expressed concern over developments that could undermine Honduras’s electoral institutions ahead of the elections, saying that the authorities and political parties should ensure that electoral bodies can operate independently and transparently.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/24/honduras-threats-to-free-fair-elections,2,-86.0755145,15.2572432,2025-11-29T21:41:32.437643+00:00

<p>(Washington, DC) – The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics undercutting protection for undocumented crime survivors weakens law enforcement’s ability to investigate and prosecute crimes, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. &nbsp;</p><p>The 50-page report, “‘We Need U’: How the U Visa Builds Trust, Counters Fear, and Promotes Community Safety,” finds that the administration’s deportation policies undermine federal visa programs that provide a pathway for crime victims to obtain legal residency when they cooperate with law enforcement. Changed enforcement guidance, such as allowing Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to apprehend people in previously safe places like courthouses and health centers, is a strong deterrent for immigrants who might otherwise report crime to police or seek a protective order.</p><p>“Despite strong rhetoric about cracking down on crime, the Trump administration’s enforcement actions and policies are benefiting abusers, making it less likely that they will be apprehended and prosecuted,” said&nbsp;Sara Darehshori, consultant to Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “If the administration is serious about combatting crime, it will expand and improve visa programs that allow victims to come forward without fear of deportation.”&nbsp;</p><p>Congress created the U visa in 2000 to help combat gender-based violence, recognizing that undocumented women and children are especially vulnerable to abuse and unlikely to report crimes because they fear deportation. Under the U visa program, survivors of rape, domestic violence, trafficking, and 25 other enumerated crimes have a pathway to legal residency if they cooperate with law enforcement or another certifying agency, have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse, and are otherwise admissible to the&nbsp;United States.&nbsp;</p><p>The program is designed to ensure that abusers cannot weaponize the threat of deportation to prevent victims from going to police and to strengthen law enforcement’s ability to investigate and prosecute crime.</p><p>Researchers conducted 43 interviews between May and October 2025 with law enforcement officials, immigration lawyers, advocates, and crime victims from around the country to better understand the impact of the program.</p><p>In one example, a woman’s boyfriend brutally beat her in June 2023. He punched her, cut her hand and face with a knife, hit her with a bottle, and choked her to the point of unconsciousness. He threatened to kill her, saying that she would end up in a “body bag.” She was transported to a hospital emergency room, where she was treated for severe lacerations and a fractured shoulder. While there, she worked up the courage to report the abuse to the New York Police Department, a decision she believes saved her life. She is now awaiting her U visa.</p><p>“Abusers regularly use threats of deportation and separation from children to prevent their victims from going to police,” Darehshori said, “The aggressive enforcement tactics being used by ICE under the Trump administration will likely make survivors more reluctant than ever to access the help they need.”</p><p>An Alliance for Immigrant Survivors&nbsp;survey reinforces fears that the Trump administration’s enforcement practices have given abusers a powerful tool for controlling their victims. Of 170 advocates and attorneys surveyed nationwide in the spring of 2025, over 75 percent said their clients are fearful of contacting the police and over 70 percent said their clients have concerns about going to court for a matter related to their abuser.&nbsp;</p><p>Benefits of the U visa program stretch beyond intimate partner violence cases and immigrant communities. Studies link those responsible for domestic violence to a wide array of other crimes outside of the home. People interviewed described cases of immigrant victims providing essential help in wage theft cases, murders, robberies, hate crimes, and stranger rape or sexual assault cases. They also described multiple safeguards within the program that ensure that any false claims are caught.&nbsp;</p><p>The U visa program is far from perfect, Human Rights Watch said. Too few visas are available, it takes years for victims to obtain one, and the process can seem arbitrary since law enforcement has a great deal of discretion on whether to provide the certification required for a successful application.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the program is a crucial tool to keep people in the United States safer and for the government to meet its human rights obligations to address gender-based violence and protect victims. Congress should embrace measures to strengthen and expand the program, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The U visa helps break through the fear that often silences survivors and gives them the security to seek help and support investigations without risking their families’ well-being,” said Saloni Sethi, commissioner of the New York City’s Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence. “Strengthening and streamlining the U visa process would allow more survivors to come forward and receive the support they deserve, help prosecute offenders, and contribute to a safer New York City.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/02/us-immigration-policy-undermines-public-safety,2,-87.6313705,41.8753081,2025-12-02T23:29:24.878910+00:00

<p>Nongovernmental groups have&nbsp;sounded the alarm as the European Parliament’s new “Scrutiny Working Group” on funding for nongovernmental groups held its&nbsp;first meeting on November 26. The inquiry is painted as an effort to boost transparency of the use of EU grants by civil society. But its superfluous mandate, narrow focus on nonprofit organizations, and biased composition make it look like a&nbsp;political witch hunt designed to silence and stigmatize the groups.</p><p>Right and far-right political groups that have&nbsp;repeatedly demonstrated hostility toward independent watchdogs created the scrutiny body. The Greens and Left boycotted the initiative, while the socialists and liberals&nbsp;staged a walkout at the inaugural meeting.</p><p>Robust oversight of EU spending already exists and all beneficiaries of EU funding must meet among the strongest transparency requirements in the world. Programs like&nbsp;LIFE, the EU’s funding instrument for climate action at the center of scrutiny, are strictly monitored. Neither the&nbsp;European Commission, nor the parliament’s budgetary committee through its mandated budget&nbsp;discharge procedures, nor a recent&nbsp;audit by the European Court of Auditors have found any evidence of wrongdoing by nongovernmental groups.</p><p>Public funding typically allows organizations to independently perform essential watchdog functions, offer independent expertise, support and represent vulnerable groups, and ensure that basic rights are safeguarded against powerful private interests. Weakening their funding undermines nongovernmental groups’ legitimate role in the policy making process and threatens to erode the rule of law.</p><p>This scrutiny body adds to mounting concerns over the&nbsp;erosion of civic space in the EU. Independent groups face criminal charges, smear campaigns, administrative obstacles, and abusive lawsuits. These tactics extend to countries like&nbsp;France, where regulations and threats of funding cuts stifle civil society;&nbsp;Greece and&nbsp;Italy, which heavily obstruct and criminalize migrant rights defenders; and&nbsp;Germany, where civil society groups face&nbsp;politically motivated scrutiny.&nbsp;Hungary has notoriously targeted civil society under the guise of protecting national sovereignty and is considering a repressive law to defund and dissolve organizations seen as “foreign-influenced.”</p><p>Civil society organizations welcome transparent accountability applied fairly across all beneficiaries. EU lawmakers should uphold civil society’s essential contribution to democratic resilience, and take measures to strengthen, not marginalize, their much-needed work.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/02/eu-right-wing-lawmakers-target-civil-society,2,125.0695955,11.2806901,2025-12-02T23:29:26.849736+00:00

<p>(Bangkok) – The&nbsp;Hong Kong government should ensure a transparent investigation and accountability for wrongful acts linked to the residential fire that killed at least&nbsp;151 people and injured 79, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>On November 26, 2025, a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a housing complex under maintenance. The government’s&nbsp;preliminary investigations found that some of the construction netting covering the eight buildings did not meet fire safety standards, and arrested 13 people linked to the maintenance company for manslaughter. Hong Kong authorities should establish an independent commission to investigate the fire, stop suppressing criticism, and drop charges against three people arrested for peaceful activism.</p><p>“The Wang Fuk Court fire raises serious concerns about the Chinese government’s crushing of what had been Hong Kong’s free press, democratic legislature, and vibrant civil society, and the impact on government oversight and safety,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s crucially important not to treat those demanding answers for the tragic fire as criminals.”</p><p>Since the fire, there have been growing demands for government accountability. Wang Fuk Court residents had previously&nbsp;protested the hiring of the maintenance company with a poor compliance record, alleging&nbsp;bid-rigging and corruption. They had also filed safety complaints, including&nbsp;concerning the building materials, which the authorities ignored, media reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Hong Kong authorities have suppressed peaceful criticism and grassroots initiatives. On November 28, hundreds&nbsp;gathered near Wang Fuk Court to donate and distribute supplies to victims. But as the initiative gained popularity, the government sent in the&nbsp;police, demanded that the volunteers leave, and had&nbsp;government workers take over the site.</p><p>On November 29, police detained Miles Kwan Ching-fung, a university student who started an online&nbsp;petition calling for an independent investigation. Kwan was&nbsp;reportedly arrested on suspicion of “seditious intention,” a national security crime. Although he was seen leaving the police station on December 1, the police released no information about the case. Kwan’s online petition and an associated Instagram account were taken down.</p><p>On December 1, local media&nbsp;reported that national security police took away two people—a volunteer who assisted victims, and the former district councilor Kenneth Cheung Kam-hung—on suspicion of “inciting hatred against the government.” Again, the police did not disclose any information.</p><p>The Hong Kong Security Bureau chief, Chris Tang Ping-Keung, has&nbsp;accused people of spreading misinformation and characterized such acts as “destabilizing Hong Kong.” The Chinese government’s Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong&nbsp;warned that any “anti-China and anti-Hong Kong” actors who attempted to use the disaster to “incite hatred toward the government” would be punished under the city’s draconian national security laws.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities should not respond to public criticism following disasters in a manner similar to China’s government, Human Rights Watch said. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the 2011 Wenzhou high-speed rail collision, and the 2022 Covid outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese authorities&nbsp;imprisoned citizens calling for accountability, muzzled whistleblowers, victims and their families,&nbsp;censored information, and even&nbsp;destroyed evidence.</p><p>By contrast, Hong Kong authorities responded to a&nbsp;deadly fire in 1996, when Hong Kong was still a British colony, by carrying out a sweeping independent investigation that improved building safety standards.</p><p>The current oppression in Hong Kong has not completely deterred people from publicly expressing their views. Thousands of Hong Kong people have laid flowers at a site near Wang Fuk Court. After Kwan’s detention, Hongkongers abroad, including those who have fled because of the draconian national security laws, started an&nbsp;online petition to demand accountability, and  organized vigils and protests in Australia,&nbsp;Germany,&nbsp;Japan, the&nbsp;United Kingdom, and other countries.</p><p>“The Hong Kong government should set up an independent inquiry into the fire instead of threatening to arrest people who are asking hard questions,” Pearson said. “This tragedy can’t be reversed but the authorities can avoid compounding it by holding those responsible—including government officials—to account and adequately compensating the victims.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/hong-kong-deadly-fire-demands-transparency-accountability,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-02T23:29:26.850150+00:00

<p>(Bangkok) – Thai authorities forcibly returned to Vietnam the prominent Montagnard human rights activist Y Quynh Bdap, putting him at risk of torture and other serious abuses, Human Rights Watch said today.&nbsp;</p><p>Thai authorities extradited Bdap, 33, on November 28, 2025, two days after Thailand’s Court of Appeal upheld a criminal court’s 2024 ruling that he could be sent back to Vietnam. Thai immigration police initially arrested Bdap on immigration charges in Bangkok in 2024, after Vietnamese authorities requested his extradition. Bdap had been living in Thailand since 2018 and had been recognized as a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; his deportation violates the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning people to places where they are likely to face persecution.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Thai government has blatantly violated the country’s anti-torture law and its international legal obligations by returning Y Quynh Bdap to Vietnam, where he faces a prison sentence after an unfair trial and the risk of torture,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Thai government’s willingness to assist Vietnam in repressing human rights activists is appalling.”</p><p>The Vietnamese government persecuted Bdap for years, Human Rights Watch said. Vietnamese state&nbsp;media have accused him of being from a family with “a tradition” of opposing the Vietnamese Communist Party and accused his grandfather of being “a henchman” for the United States during the Vietnam War. His father was imprisoned for three years for “inciting” a public protest.</p><p>In 2016, Bdap traveled to Thailand for a conference on religious freedom. When he returned to Vietnam, the Vietnamese police detained him for seven days and interrogated him about his trip. He was subsequently placed under intrusive surveillance, leading him to flee to Bangkok in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>While in Thailand, Bdap founded the Montagnards Stand for Justice, which sought to protect and promote the right to freedom of religion and other rights of Montagnards in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. An Indigenous minority, Montagnards have faced political persecution, forced&nbsp;repudiation of their religious beliefs,&nbsp;shuttering of Christian house churches, and&nbsp;constant monitoring and surveillance by Vietnam security forces.</p><p>In June 2023, after an outbreak of violence in Dak Lak province in the Central Highlands, authorities arrested scores of Montagnards and criminally charged them and several others in exile, including Bdap, with “terrorism” and other crimes. During a short mass trial by a “mobile court” in January 2024 involving about 100 defendants, Bdap was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>In early March 2024, the Vietnamese government, without providing tangible evidence, labeled the Montagnards Stand for Justice and the Montagnard Support Group as “terrorist” organizations linked to the Dak Lak violence and other anti-state criminal activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Days later, Vietnamese police traveled to Thailand and visited two neighborhoods near Bangkok with populations of Montagnard asylum seekers and refugees, questioning dozens about Bdap’s whereabouts, intimidating several with accusations of illegally departing Vietnam, and urging them to return to Vietnam or face criminal charges and extradition.</p><p>Thai police then arrested Bdap in June on the basis of an extradition request by Vietnamese authorities. He had been in prison during his extradition trial and appeal, up until his forced return to Vietnam on November 28.</p><p>In a November 2025 report, Human Rights Watch documented how Vietnam has increasingly engaged in transnational repression in Thailand, targeting especially exiled ethnic minorities with harassment and intimidation. Thai authorities have increasingly participated in these abuses by cooperating with Vietnamese authorities and allowing Vietnamese police to interrogate asylum seekers and refugees. Exiles and immigration lawyers believe the Vietnam government presses Thailand to keep some exiles in immigration detention indefinitely, by denying them bail, to pressure them to cooperate with Vietnamese police.</p><p>UN human rights experts have criticized the misuse of terrorism charges in the 2024 mass trial of Montagnards in Vietnam and the reported use of evidence obtained by torture, and have said that targeting Bdap for his association with the Montagnards Stand For Justice is part of the intensifying discrimination and repression against the Montagnard population. Human Rights Watch has no information about Bdap’s involvement in the 2023 violence in Dak Lak but considers his trial in Vietnam unfair and is gravely concerned about his safety following his extradition to Vietnam.</p><p>Vietnamese authorities have not yet confirmed that they have Bdap in their custody.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerned foreign governments should strongly press the Vietnamese government to disclose his whereabouts and request access to him given the high risk of torture and other ill-treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Bdap’s extradition violates Thailand’s Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act, which prohibits extradition when there is a substantial risk of torture or ill-treatment upon return.&nbsp;</p><p>Thailand is also obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment, or a threat to their life. This principle is codified in the Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, and customary international law.</p><p>“The Bdap case demonstrates the Thai government’s unwillingness to respect international law and protect foreign human rights advocates who live in Thailand,” Pearson said. “Concerned governments should expedite resettlement of Vietnamese and other nationals at risk in Thailand to places where they will be safe.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/02/thailand-montagnard-activist-extradited-to-vietnam,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-02T23:29:26.850490+00:00

<p>When 29-year-old Norbert Amoya went to fetch water from a river in northern Zambia earlier this year, he found large numbers of dead fish and the water had a strange smell. The cause was a major mining disaster. On February 18, a dam at a Chinese copper mine had burst&nbsp;and released toxic waste into a tributary of Zambia’s largest river, threatening the ecosystem, the livelihood of millions, and putting communities at grave risk of cancer and other ill-health.</p><p>Such disasters can be prevented.</p><p>This week, states coming together for the United Nations Environment Assembly, the world’s top environmental policymaking body, will deliberate on measures to do so. The Colombian government has taken the lead by proposing a new global treaty to address environmental risks in mining, including due diligence and traceability in mineral supply chains. Many other governments, including Armenia, Ecuador, Oman, and pollution-affected Zambia, are joining the initiative, which calls for the “environmentally sound management of minerals and metals”.</p><p>As US environmental protections and the EU supply chains law are being weakened, this initiative marks a bold move welcomed by civil society groups, including Human Rights Watch.</p><p>As a first step, Colombia and its allies propose a UN working group to explore options for binding and non-binding measures. Such working groups have previously been successful at initiating treaty processes.</p><p>But there is pushback and negotiations at the summit will likely be tough, as some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia oppose any binding measures.</p><p>Voluntary measures by businesses are not sufficient to protect human rights and the environment, as investigations by Human Rights Watch and others have repeatedly shown. In Zambia, while the Chinese company provided some compensation payments to community members, it also reportedly suppressed a study on the full scale of the disaster. &nbsp;</p><p>As demand for minerals for energy transition, defense, and other technology increases, it is vital that governments around the world work to protect the environment and ensure human rights safeguards in global mineral supply chains. All governments attending this week’s assembly should support Colombia’s initiative for a binding minerals treaty. &nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/an-opportunity-to-address-mining-abuses-globally,0,-74.2973,4.5709,2025-12-02T23:29:26.850859+00:00

<p>(Geneva, December 1, 2025) – The global ban on antipersonnel landmines saves civilian lives but faces serious threats from countries leaving the treaty and new landmine use, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing the “Landmine Monitor 2025”&nbsp;report. Member countries should take immediate and strong action to counter these life-threatening developments.</p>

<p>The 163-page report assesses implementation of and adherence to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which comprehensively prohibits the use of antipersonnel mines and requires states parties to destroy stockpiles, clear mine-affected areas, and assist victims.&nbsp;</p><p>“Governments should be loud and clear in condemning states’ withdrawal from the Mine Ban Treaty and rejecting attempts to suspend core treaty obligations during armed conflict,” said Mark Hiznay, associate Crisis, Conflict, and Arms director at Human Rights Watch and an editor of&nbsp;“Landmine Monitor 2025.” “A strong response is vital not only for saving lives but also preserving respect for international humanitarian law and human rights law.”&nbsp;</p><p>Antipersonnel mines kill and wound people indiscriminately. They are typically placed by hand but can also be scattered by aircraft, rockets, artillery, and drones or dispersed from specialized vehicles. Uncleared landmines remain a danger until located and destroyed. Mined land can drive displacement of civilians, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities.</p>

<p>As of December 1, 2025, 166 countries have joined the treaty, including the Marshall Islands and Tonga in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Five states parties moved to withdraw in 2025, citing regional security concerns. Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia submitted their instruments of withdrawal on June 27, Finland on July 10, and Poland on August 20. These withdrawals will take effect six months after those dates if states do not reconsider their position or engage in armed conflict during that period.&nbsp;</p><p>At least 22 states parties, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines as well as the United Nations secretary-general, more than 100 Nobel laureates, and other distinguished individuals have expressed deep concern at these withdrawals. At least 80,000 people from across Europe signed a petition urging the countries not to withdraw.&nbsp;</p><p>Ukraine’s announcement on July 21 that it would suspend its obligations under the Mine Ban Treaty until the end of its war with Russia also causes concern. Suspension is unlawful under the treaty, which has prohibitions that cannot be waived during armed conflict. Several states have submitted objections to Ukraine’s suspension to the UN.&nbsp;</p><p>Russia has used antipersonnel landmines extensively in Ukraine since its full-scale invasion of the country on February 24, 2022, causing thousands of casualties and contaminating vast tracts of land. Human Rights Watch reported that Russian forces were modifying commercial quadcopter drones to scatter antipersonnel mines in and around the city of Kherson, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds.</p><p>Over the past year, social media photos and videos increasingly indicate new use of antipersonnel mines by Ukrainian armed forces, though the scale is unclear. Ukraine requested and received antipersonnel mines from the United States in November and December 2024. Publicly available information also suggests that Ukraine is making mines, including for placement by drones.</p><p>Ukraine continues to investigate reports that their forces used antipersonnel mines in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when it was occupied by Russian forces.</p><p>“Landmine Monitor 2025” also includes documentation of new use of antipersonnel mines by national armed forces in Myanmar, Iran, and North Korea in 2024 and the first half of 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of border clashes in July 2025, Thailand alleged that Cambodian military forces placed antipersonnel landmines along their shared border, and reports have emerged of Thai soldiers injured by antipersonnel mines. Cambodia has denied these allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonstate armed groups used landmines in at least 13 countries during 2024 and the first half of 2025, particularly in the Sahel region of Africa, Colombia, India, Pakistan, and Myanmar.&nbsp;</p><p>“Landmine Monitor 2025” reported at least 6,279 new casualties from landmines and explosive remnants of war in 52 countries and areas in 2024, including 1,945 deaths. Civilians made up 90 percent of all recorded casualties, while children accounted for 46 percent in which the age was recorded.&nbsp;</p><p>The Myanmar armed forces’ use of mines led to 2,029 recorded casualties from landmines or explosive remnants of war in 2024, the most of any country. In 2024, Human Rights Watch documented that the Myanmar junta planted landmines in homes, villages, and farms.&nbsp;</p><p>Syria had the second largest number, with 1,015 recorded deaths or injuries. Earlier in 2025, Human Rights Watch documented the significant harm from extensive landmine contamination across Syria, including for displaced people returning home after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>A total of 1,115 kilometers of contaminated land was cleared globally in 2024, nearly three times more than in 2023, and 105,640 antipersonnel mines were destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite an increase in overall funding for mine action, largely for Ukraine, international funding for such efforts decreased 5 percent in 2024. The US remained the largest donor, but its contribution decreased by more than one-third from 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Some states parties with landmine contamination, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, continued to struggle to obtain financial support from international donors.&nbsp;</p><p>“Clearing contaminated land is crucial to saving lives and allowing communities to regain access to their land and carry out their livelihoods,” Hiznay said. “Concerned states should ensure that all countries in need get clearance support.”</p><p>The “Landmine Monitor 2025” is a publication by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the global coalition of nongovernmental organizations that received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. Human Rights Watch co-founded the campaign in 1992 and contributes to its Landmine Monitor reporting initiative.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/landmines-action-needed-to-reinforce-ban,4,-74.2973,4.5709,2025-12-02T23:29:26.851244+00:00

The International Criminal Court (ICC) is under assault by the&nbsp;United States and&nbsp;Russia, among others, which are determined to undermine its mandate as the court of last resort.ICC member countries need to stay firm in their defense of the court so that impartial justice remains a critical part of the rules-based international order.ICC member countries should use their annual meeting to defend the court human rights groups, and others cooperating with it, and to enforce judicial findings against members who fail to arrest and surrender those sought by the court.<p>(The Hague) – Member countries of the&nbsp;International Criminal Court (ICC) should intensify efforts to protect the court and human rights groups campaigning for justice from attack, Human Rights Watch said in a new report. The&nbsp;20-page report makes detailed recommendations for the annual session of the ICC’s Assembly of States Parties, which will meet in The Hague, Netherlands, from December 1 to 6, 2025.</p><p>Throughout 2025, the US administration of President Donald Trump&nbsp;has imposed sanctions against court officials, a United Nations expert, and Palestinian civil society organizations in an attack on justice and the international rule of law. Russian arrest warrants issued in 2023 and 2024&nbsp;against ICC officials remain pending. In June, the court faced a second serious cyber-attack with the purpose of espionage.</p><p>“Government efforts to undermine the ICC reflect broader attacks on the global rule of law, aiming to disable institutions that seek to hold those responsible for the worst crimes to account,” said&nbsp;Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “ICC member countries need to stay firm in their defense of the court so that impartial justice remains a critical part of the rules-based international order.”</p><p>The Assembly session takes place amid important ICC achievements over the past year. In March, the Philippines&nbsp;surrendered former President Rodrigo Duterte to the court to face charges of crimes against humanity related to the country’s notorious “war on drugs,” which killed tens of thousands of people. In October, ICC judges handed down a&nbsp;landmark conviction of a former “Janjaweed” militia leader for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur,&nbsp;Sudan.</p><p>On February 6, President Trump&nbsp;issued an executive order authorizing asset freezes and entry bans on ICC officials and others supporting the court’s work. The order clearly seeks to shield US and Israeli officials from facing charges before the ICC. In November 2024, ICC judges had&nbsp;issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in&nbsp;Gaza.</p><p>The US government has used the executive order to impose sanctions on the ICC prosecutor and&nbsp;two deputy prosecutors,&nbsp;six of the court’s judges,&nbsp;the United Nations special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, and&nbsp;three leading Palestinian human rights organizations: Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.</p><p>Government sanctions should only be used to target those who are committing serious crimes, not those who document and deliver justice for such crimes, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>If unchecked, US sanctions could severely set back the global fight against impunity.&nbsp;Individuals and&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;targeted by the US sanctions have lost funding alongside access to bank accounts and other financial services, and face social media restrictions. Financial institutions often comply with US sanctions to minimize their risk and may preemptively refuse transactions with the ICC, jeopardizing the court’s work across the globe.</p><p>ICC member countries should seize opportunities during the Assembly session to showcase their strong support for the court and human rights defenders, Human Rights Watch said. ICC states parties have issued&nbsp;individual and joint statements condemning the US sanctions, and they can build on these at the session to demonstrate that they will not be deterred in their support.</p><p>They should also pledge to take further concrete action to limit or, where possible, nullify the effects of sanctions and other coercive measures against the court, its officials, and those cooperating with it, including within civil society. The&nbsp;European Union has yet to act to use its&nbsp;blocking statute, which could provide a measure of protection from the unlawful effect of US sanctions. At the session, EU member states should call on the regional bloc to activate the statute.</p><p>Other issues on the Assembly’s agenda include addressing recent failures by ICC member countries—Italy,&nbsp;Hungary, and&nbsp;Tajikistan—to cooperate in the arrest of individuals wanted by the court who were on their territory. Without arrests, the court cannot provide justice, and it relies on governments to carry out arrests.</p><p>This is the first time in 24 years that the Assembly will hold a dedicated plenary session on the issue of non-cooperation. It will consider a&nbsp;finding from the court’s judges that Hungary violated its legal obligations when it failed to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on his visit to Budapest in April. Member countries should not miss this opportunity to carry out their responsibility to enforce the judges’ finding and prepare the ground to respond to future ones before the Assembly, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>ICC member countries will also set the ICC’s budget for 2026. The court made a fiscally conservative request, focusing primarily on the institution’s resilience in the face of ongoing challenges, including the US sanctions. Member countries should ensure that the court has sufficient resources in its regular budget for next year to build the necessary resilience, while also continuing to robustly carry out its global mandate, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The ICC has flaws but it remains the court of last resort for thousands of victims and their families who have nowhere else to turn,” Evenson said. “By standing together at their annual session, ICC countries can send the message loud and clear that they remain undeterred and unrelenting in the fight for justice.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/international-criminal-court-justice-at-risk,6,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-02T23:29:26.851594+00:00

<p>(Berlin, December 4, 2025) – Georgian authorities have adopted a series of laws that unjustifiably interfere with the right to peaceful assembly and are being used to suppress dissent, Human Rights Watch said today. Combined with abusive policing and steep fines, these measures violate Georgians’ right to peaceful protest, making dissent increasingly risky and leaving critics vulnerable to punitive measures.</p><p>“The Georgian government is systematically dismantling protections for peaceful assembly and free expression,” said Giorgi Gogia, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “People are being detained or slapped with ruinous fines for exercising their fundamental rights.”</p><p>Massive nationwide protests have swept Georgia following the ruling party’s November 2024 decision to abandon Georgia’s EU accession process. Authorities have responded to the protests with police violence, and local rights groups have documented hundreds of detentions on alleged administrative grounds and thousands of fines for alleged violations of protest-related rules. Together, this has created a hostile and punitive environment for peaceful protest.</p><p>Since November 2024, the ruling party has rushed multiple legislative amendments through the parliament, essentially criminalizing a wide range of protest-related actions integral to the peaceful exercise of the right to assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>December 2024 amendments impose tenfold increases in fines—from 500 to 5,000 Georgian lari (about US$185 to 1,850)—for ordinary protest conduct, including blocking building entrances, painting political graffiti, wearing masks, or possessing laser pointers. The new fine is about twice Georgia’s average monthly income, which stands at 2,212 lari (about $820). These fines reach levels typical of criminal liability, but since they are labeled as administrative offenses, the accused do not benefit from the safeguards of criminal procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>The December 2024 amendments also grant police vague preventive arrest and frisking powers, allowing them to “preventively” detain individuals for up to 48 hours if they had previously been implicated in an administrative offense and deemed likely to reoffend. Such broad grounds for detention are not permitted under human rights law and violate the prohibition on arbitrary arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>Amendments adopted in February 2025 extend detention for administrative offenses from 15 to 60 days, a change applied almost exclusively to protest-related offenses, such as petty hooliganism, disobeying police orders, or violating assembly rules. They also introduced new offenses, including “verbal insult” of officials, punishable by up to 45 days’ detention, and imposed new restrictions by subjecting spontaneous assemblies to notification requirements and requiring prior written consent for indoor gatherings.&nbsp;</p><p>In July, the parliament adopted further coercive measures, introducing automatic 30-60-day detention for anyone with unpaid prior fines who committed even a minor assembly-related offense.</p><p>October legislative amendments elevated repeated minor conduct—such as wearing a mask, blocking a roadway, installing temporary structures, or participating in a police-terminated protest—to felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison, and up to four years for those deemed organizers.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, these laws transform routine protest activity into conduct punishable by criminal-level sanctions, reduce clarity about what conduct is legal and therefore the ability of people to regulate their behavior accordingly, and vastly expand police discretion to interfere with public gatherings, Human Rights Watch said, violating Georgia’s obligations under international human rights law.&nbsp;</p><p>Georgian authorities have enforced the new restrictions through arbitrary detentions and abusive administrative proceedings, often imposing sanctions equivalent to criminal penalties. Police have detained protesters for wearing masks, briefly stepping onto the road, or allegedly blocking traffic. &nbsp;</p><p>Interviews with defense lawyers indicate that convictions that often lack sufficient evidence to establish criminal wrongdoing frequently rely on video surveillance footage, including through the reported use of facial recognition technology, to identify protesters.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawyers handling dozens of such cases told Human Rights Watch that officers who claim to identify protesters from surveillance footage are never questioned in court, and judges routinely ignore the heightened procedural safeguards required when detention is at stake.</p><p>The financial penalties imposed under the new laws have been punitive and disproportionate. In one such case, courts fined Gota Chanturia, 36, a teacher and education researcher, a total of 365,000 lari (about $135,200) for 73 alleged instances of “road-blocking.” According to Chanturia’s lawyer, police presented short surveillance footage showing Chanturia peacefully standing on the roadway near the parliament. Chanturia’s 60-year-old father has accumulated around 70 similar fines, including in situations where the roadway had already been closed by police. The lawyer said that the courts in both cases offered no justification for upholding such extreme penalties and instead simply confirmed fines issued by the Interior Ministry without assessing their proportionality.</p><p>Lawyers representing dozens of protest-related cases described the same pattern: sanctions imposed without meaningful evidence review and without assessing whether fines—often equivalent to years of income—are proportionate.</p><p>Human Rights Watch also spoke with other protesters who have faced repeated detentions and large fines. For instance, philologist Rusudan Kobakhidze, 61, who was already serving time in detention for alleged administrative offenses, also had three other 5,000-lari (about $1,185) fines imposed, despite a monthly income far below the cost of a single penalty.&nbsp;</p><p>The combination of open intimidation along with arbitrary arrests and overwhelming fines has created a pervasive climate of fear around participation in peaceful assemblies, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs publishes only limited statistical data, making it impossible to determine the full scope of protest-related penalties. Even so, available figures are alarming. In 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, authorities sanctioned 4,444 people for petty hooliganism and 6,725 for disobeying police orders—charges often used against protesters—and imposed detention in 6,504 cases.</p><p>As a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, Georgia is obligated to protect the rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly, and any restrictions must not only be for a lawful purpose and have a proper legal basis, but must also comply with the requirements of necessity and proportionality. These safeguards are intended to ensure, amongst other things, that people can participate in public life without fear of abusive policing, arbitrary arrest, or disproportionate sanctions.&nbsp;</p><p>The convention also requires Georgia to apply criminal due process safeguards to any offense that in substance attracts criminal liability, even if authorities label it as administrative under domestic law. This means examining the nature of the offense, including if it is directed at the public in general, and the severity of the potential penalty. This standard ensures that authorities cannot evade their obligations to uphold due process by mischaracterizing offenses, and helps identify when governments are effectively criminalizing behavior that does not substantially rise to that level and may instead be seeking to suppress legitimate activity. &nbsp;<br /><br />Prominent international bodies have warned that Georgia’s recent legislative changes fall far short of these standards. The Council of Europe’s Venice Commission found that the December 2024 amendments significantly undermine freedom of assembly, noting that vague provisions and harsh penalties risk creating a “chilling effect” on participation. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, in urgent opinions issued in March and November 2025, criticized the expanded detention powers and disproportionate sanctions, cautioning that the new measures could be used to silence or punish peaceful protesters and civil society activists for legitimate public engagement.</p><p>“Over the past year, the Georgian government’s response to mass public protests has been a coordinated drive to suppress criticism and keep people off the streets,” Gogia said. “Georgia’s international partners should press the authorities to urgently reverse this repressive course and restore space for peaceful assembly.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/04/georgia-repressive-laws-effectively-criminalize-peaceful-protests,2,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-04T16:08:01.146426+00:00

<p>(Washington, DC) – FIFA, the international soccer governing body, needs&nbsp;to&nbsp;match its lofty rhetoric on rights with concrete action, a coalition of human rights organizations, trade unions, and fans groups said today. FIFA is holding its World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 5, 2025, and awarding its first “FIFA Peace Prize.”&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;Sport &amp; Rights Alliance, Dignity 2026, ACLU, AFL-CIO, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Independent Supporters Council, NAACP, Athlete Ally, and Reporters Without Borders have come together to press FIFA to deliver a World Cup that respects the rights of fans, players, workers, journalists, and local communities.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, represents an opportunity to implement a new model for FIFA events—one that supports strong workers’ protections, safeguards children’s rights, upholds media freedom, and ensures that working people and communities benefit from hosting this mega-sporting event, the groups said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Workers, athletes, fans, and communities make the World Cup possible,” said Andrea Florence, executive director of the Sport &amp; Rights Alliance. “The 2026 World Cup is the first to begin with human rights criteria embedded in the bidding process. But the deteriorating human rights situation in the United States has put those commitments at risk.”</p><p>With 200 days until kickoff, the&nbsp;escalating attacks on immigrants in the United States, FIFA’s&nbsp;cancellation of anti-discrimination messaging, and threats to press freedom and the rights of peaceful protesters signal a tournament heading in the wrong direction, the human rights and labor groups said.</p><p>There has been no transparency around FIFA’s Peace Prize process. Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;written to FIFA to request a list of the nominees, the judges, the criteria, and the process for the Peace Prize. Human Rights Watch received no response.</p><p>“FIFA’s so-called peace prize is being awarded against a backdrop of violent detentions of immigrants, national guard deployments in US cities, and the obsequious&nbsp;cancellation of FIFA’s own anti-racism and anti-discrimination campaigns,” said Minky Worden, who oversees sport for Human Rights Watch. “There is still time to honor FIFA’s promises for a World Cup not tainted by human rights abuses, but the clock is ticking.”</p><p>The following are areas of concern spotlighted by experts from the civil society groups:</p><p>Workers’ Rights</p><p>“The men’s 2026 FIFA World Cup is an opportunity to implement a new model for FIFA events that supports strong worker rights protections and ensures that working people and communities benefit from hosting this kind of mega-sporting events,” said Cathy Feingold, International Director at the AFL-CIO, and ITUC Deputy President. “Workers make the World Cup possible from working in the stadiums, preparing the infrastructure and playing in the matches to providing the entertainment. Given the work they do to make the games possible, FIFA must uphold its commitments that the games will be played with the effective implementation of worker and human rights.”</p><p>Media Freedom</p><p>“Every four years, billions of people turn their attention to the World Cup and its host countries,” said Clayton Weimers, executive director, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) USA. “They rely on journalists to deliver reliable information with appropriate context to tell the story of this tournament both on and off the field. Unfortunately, journalists in the US are seeing their access restricted, their visas threatened, and their safety put into question. FIFA and the host governments must guarantee the freedom and safety of journalists before, during, and after the 2026 World Cup.”</p><p>Immigration and Law Enforcement&nbsp;</p><p>“The Trump administration has aggressively pursued a systematic anti-human rights campaign to target, detain, and disappear immigrants in communities across the US – including the deployment of the National Guard in cities where the World Cup will take place,” said&nbsp;Jamil Dakwar, human rights director at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “FIFA’s own policy states that they will leverage their business relationships to mitigate adverse human rights impacts – and it’s critical that they wield that influence to end rights violations including freedom of speech and assembly rights. We call on FIFA to honor its human rights commitments, not capitulate to Trump’s authoritarianism.”</p><p>“Attending a soccer match should never result in arbitrary detention or deportation,” said Daniel Noroña, Americas Advocacy Director, Amnesty International USA. “The threat of excessive policing, including immigration enforcement, at World Cup venues is deeply troubling, and FIFA cannot be silent. FIFA must obtain binding guarantees from US authorities that the tournament will be a safe space for all, regardless of political stance, opinion or immigration status.”</p><p>Civil Rights and Anti-Discrimination</p><p>“FIFA’s decision to cancel anti-racism and anti-discrimination messaging at the Club World Cup sent a chilling signal to communities of color and all who have fought for equality in sport,” said Jamal Watkins, senior vice president of strategy and advancement, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). “At a time when hate crimes are rising and DEI programs are under attack, FIFA should not be retreating.”</p><p>Athletes’ Rights and LGBTQ+ Safety</p><p>“As an out athlete, I know what it means to compete in environments where you’re not sure you’ll be safe,” said Matthew Pacifici, former men’s professional player in the US and&nbsp;Athlete Ally ambassador. “LGBTQ+ players and fans need more than symbolic gestures—we need enforceable protections. The&nbsp;homophobic chants at the Club World Cup in Atlanta show exactly why FIFA’s retreat from anti-discrimination messaging is so dangerous. Players and fans must know that FIFA will protect them, not abandon them.”</p><p>Supporters’ Voice and Fan Safety</p><p>“Supporters are the backbone of this sport, yet FIFA keeps making decisions about our safety without ever talking to the people who actually show up,” said Bailey Brown, president, Independent Supporters Council. “You cannot claim to ‘unite the world’ while shutting out the very fans who bring the energy and passion to every match. We’re asking for something simple: transparency, real consultation, and concrete protections for every supporter at the 2026 World Cup.”</p><p>Safeguarding Children</p><p>“It is unacceptable that FIFA has&nbsp;no child safeguarding policy for the 2026 World Cup,” said Katherine La Puente, children’s rights senior coordinator at Human Rights Watch. “Risks children can face in the context of major sporting events include trafficking,&nbsp;sexual exploitation, child labor, and family displacements, among other forms of&nbsp;violence and abuse.”</p><p>Host City Residents, Communities</p><p>“For the World Cup to truly ‘unite the world,’ both FIFA and host committees need to ensure that the rights and dignity of everyone, whether residents or visitors, are protected and not exploited,” said Jennifer Li, coordinator of Dignity 2026 and director of the Center for Community Health Innovation at Georgetown Law. “For example, people who are unsheltered should not be criminalized for their status or displaced as part of so-called beautification efforts. FIFA and host cities have a responsibility to ensure that hosting communities benefit from this event, and that the most vulnerable residents do not bear the greatest costs.”</p><p>Host City Plans</p><p>As part of FIFA’s&nbsp;human rights framework for the 2026 World Cup, each of the 16 host cities is&nbsp;required to develop its own “human rights action plan” to prevent discrimination, support workers’ rights, protect children, and combat human trafficking.</p><p>Human Rights Watch, along with the Sport &amp; Rights Alliance, Dignity 2026, and their member organizations, are calling on FIFA and host committees to:&nbsp;</p>Reinstate anti-discrimination messaging;Commit to ensuring effective protections against racial profiling, arbitrary detention, and unlawful immigration enforcement during the tournament;Work closely with community partners on finalizing the Human Rights Action Plans;Take effective steps to ensure respect for the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful protest;Announce and implement a comprehensive Child Safeguarding Policy;Ensure meaningful community benefit from the 2026 World Cup; andTake effective steps to ensure that the 2026 World Cup does not lead to abuses of vulnerable communities, including the jailing of unhoused populations.",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/world-cup-2026-fifa-needs-to-act-on-human-rights,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-04T16:08:01.146907+00:00

<p>Since November 21, social media company X has been rolling out a new feature called “About this account,” which displays information about users that was previously not publicly disclosed. This includes the country where an account was created, is based, the date it joined X, and username changes.</p><p>The company says the feature is intended to verify authenticity and improve transparency, but it raises serious concerns about user privacy and safety. It exposes location information without meaningful user consent and lacks adequate human rights safeguards.</p><p>While the country display is the default setting on the feature, users can instead display a region “for those in countries where speech has penalties”. There appears to be no option for a user to hide their location entirely. It is not clear if the feature has been rolled out for users worldwide. &nbsp;</p><p>X is also developing a feature that warns if a user is connected through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and flags their country or region “may not be accurate.”</p><p>These changes risk compromising anonymity for those whose safety depends on it. Online anonymity is fundamental for free speech and privacy. Combined with the growing threat of transnational repression, unmasking users’ locations and the proposed VPN detection could exacerbate safety risks for journalists, activists, and members of vulnerable communities who have fled their countries.</p><p>While X said the feature was meant to enhance transparency, reported inaccuracies in displayed location data, coupled with lack of information about the criteria used to determine these details, undermine its value. X noted that incorrect data will be “updated periodically based on best available information”.</p><p>Efforts to improve information integrity and enhance transparency should not expose individuals to harm, especially those who rely on anonymity for security.</p><p>X has not publicly stated whether it conducted a human rights impact assessment before introducing the feature, nor updated its privacy policy or informed users that their location data would be shared publicly. International human rights standards require companies to identify and mitigate human rights risks throughout the entire range of their business activities.</p><p>X should turn off the location feature or ensure users can opt-out and carry out human rights due diligence to avoid introducing features that threaten user safety.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/xs-location-disclosure-undermines-user-safety,2,-79.6371124,39.2138905,2025-12-04T16:08:02.641443+00:00

Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries of Mexico City released the 70-page Roadmap for Change, a practical guide that shows how to implement the legal capacity reform in a rights-respecting way through clear explanations, good practices, and real-life-based examples.The guide offers notaries concrete tools—including communication strategies, templates for designating supports, and illustrative case studies—to ensure that each person’s will and preferences are respected in daily practice.By providing actionable steps for notaries, judges, and institutions, the guide hopes to strengthen community-based supports and promote a shift toward autonomy, equality, and inclusion for people with disabilities and older people.<p>(Mexico City) – Mexico City’s landmark Civil Code reform on legal capacity should be carried out in a way that fully respects everyone’s autonomy and equality, including people with disabilities and older people, Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries of Mexico City said today. Their jointly issued publication, Roadmap for Change: The Path Toward Implementing the Legal Capacity Reform in Mexico City, is&nbsp;a practical guide to carrying out the reform.</p><p>The reform, which took effect in December 2024, recognizes that all adults have full legal capacity—the right to make decisions about their own lives—regardless of disability, age, or health status. It prohibits any restriction of this right based on placing the person under any protected status, to ensure that anyone may choose to receive support in exercising their rights if they wish, but can never be forced to do so.</p><p>Roberto Garzón, president of the College of Notaries of Mexico City, emphasized the importance of notaries’ leadership in making this reform a reality:</p><p>“The notary profession plays a vital role in making the principles of autonomy, equality, and dignity a lived reality for everyone,” Garzón said. “Through our daily practice, we can help ensure that no one is excluded from exercising their rights simply because they communicate, think, or make decisions differently.”</p><p>“This reform marks a historic step for human rights in Mexico City,” said Carlos Ríos Espinosa, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “It moves the city away from outdated systems that deprived people of control over their lives and toward a model that recognizes everyone’s right to make their own choices, with support when needed.”</p><p>The guide was developed jointly by Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries of Mexico City, to provide clear explanations and case studies illustrating how the reform can be applied in everyday practice. It includes examples of good practices for communicating effectively with people who may need support to make decisions, along with practical templates for designating people to provide that support.</p><p>The cases in the roadmap are hypothetical, but are based on real and recurring situations that notaries encounter across Mexico City. They reflect common consultations, concerns, and legal acts typically handled in notary offices, illustrating how the new legal framework can be used to respect the will and preferences of each individual.</p><p>The examples include:</p>A man with West syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy, who designates types of support to help him accept an inheritance from his mother and make informed decisions about investing the proceeds. The case demonstrates how notaries can facilitate accessible communication and ensure that the person’s will and preferences guide every step of the process.A 70-year-old woman, who makes an advance designation of types of support to ensure that, in the future, she can receive assistance in making decisions about managing her assets, planning investments, and her daily life. This example highlights how advance designation can safeguard autonomy while allowing people to plan for possible changing circumstances such as illness or disability.A young woman on the autism spectrum who designates types of support to help her carry out administrative procedures with public institutions. The case shows how the law enables people to choose the type of assistance they need to navigate bureaucratic systems without relinquishing their right to make their own decisions.<p>The roadmap emphasizes that the right to legal capacity is guaranteed under international human rights law, including Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), which Mexico ratified in 2007. It offers concrete recommendations to ensure that notaries and public institutions respect the will and preferences of individuals while establishing safeguards to prevent abuse or conflicts of interest.</p><p>“This reform has the potential to transform lives,” Ríos Espinosa said. “But laws alone are not enough. Implementation will require training, awareness, and a change in attitudes to ensure that people with disabilities and older people can make decisions about their own lives—where to live, how to manage their finances, what medical treatments to accept—just like everyone else.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries urged Mexico City authorities to ensure that notaries, judges, and social service providers receive continuing training on the new legal framework. They also emphasized the need for clear regulatory guidelines and accessible materials to support effective implementation, and urged other state governments to adopt and replicate this model in their own jurisdictions.</p><p>The Mexico City reform and the Roadmap for Change mark a decisive step away from substituted decision-making, such as guardianship, toward genuine support for exercising legal capacity. Together, Human Rights Watch and the College of Notaries reaffirm their shared commitment to promoting a legal culture that places autonomy and equality at the heart of justice.</p><p>“This represents not only a legal change, but a profound cultural shift,” Garzon said. “It reaffirms that all people, including those historically marginalized, have the right to make decisions about their own lives. The College of Notaries of Mexico City is proud to contribute to support this transformation by promoting professional practices that respect the will and preferences of every individual.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/mexico-city-new-era-for-people-with-disabilities-and-older-persons,2,-102.5528,23.6345,2025-12-04T16:08:02.641950+00:00

<p>(Paris) –&nbsp;French President Emmanuel Macron should privately and publicly stress the importance of human rights in Sino-French relations during his visit to&nbsp;China from December 3 to 5, 2025, Human Rights Watch said today. Macron’s visit is one of several top-level engagements between European and Chinese leaders amid the complex and shifting geopolitical relationships among Europe, China, and the United States.</p><p>President Macron should signal his commitment to taking concrete action in response to&nbsp;deepening repression by China. Key issues include labor rights abuses in China’s supply chains;&nbsp;commercial drones produced by China-based companies being used by Russia to attack civilians in Ukraine; and China’s use of transnational repression to target critics abroad, including in France.</p><p>“China’s disregard for human rights has important implications for France, from weapons used in unlawful Russian attacks in Ukraine to abusive supply chains that hinders fair competition for European industries,” said&nbsp;Bénédicte Jeannerod, France director at Human Rights Watch. “Macron should break the silos between human rights and other issues and show leadership by including rights concerns in high-level policy discussions with China.”</p><p>Efforts by France and other EU countries to address serious human rights violations in China have been hindered by a willingness to distinguish them from other economic and political aspects of the relationship, Human Rights Watch said. Macron should acknowledge their interconnection and demonstrate leadership by including human rights in its broader policy discussions with China.</p><p>The opening of the Chinese company Shein’s first physical store in Paris has raised various concerns, including a company business model that allegedly relies on&nbsp;labor abuses and deceptive&nbsp;commercial practices that include&nbsp;sourcing from state-imposed forced labor in Xinjiang.</p><p>Media and&nbsp;nongovernmental organizations have reported that Shein workers in China toil for excessive hours for very little pay. Shein has&nbsp;said it is committed to supporting suppliers to create working conditions that meet international standards for health and safety, labor, and social welfare.</p><p>Human rights groups have also documented the use of Chinese state-imposed forced labor involving Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in China’s&nbsp;cotton,&nbsp;automotive,&nbsp;solar, and&nbsp;critical mineral supply chains. The United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and other organizations have for several years reported on&nbsp;crimes against humanity by Chinese authorities in Xinjiang. a predominantly Muslim Uyghur region.</p><p>The European Union’s&nbsp;Forced Labor Regulation, once fully implemented in December 2027, will provide an important tool to block products made with forced labor from the EU market, including those from China. The risk of human rights abuses in supply chains also underscores the need to preserve the EU’s&nbsp;corporate sustainability legislation, which the EU, with the support of the French government, is currently seeking to water down.</p><p>Macron has pushed for the EU to use its “trade bazooka” law, the Anti-Coercion Instrument, to address China’s coercive trade practices. But he should reiterate that China’s full compliance with international conventions recently ratified by China—International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 29 on&nbsp;forced labor and ILO Convention No. 105 on&nbsp;state-imposed forced labor—are critical for strengthening ties between the two countries.</p><p>Human Rights Watch in June documented Russia’s use of&nbsp;commercial drones produced by China-based companies to attack civilians in Kherson, Ukraine. Macron should press the Chinese government to ensure that these drone companies prevent sales to sanctioned entities and cooperate with investigations into unlawful attacks on civilians in Ukraine.</p><p>China has also increasingly carried out cross-border abuses—known as&nbsp;transnational repression—to oppress critics of the government abroad and&nbsp;impose ideological control, including in&nbsp;France.</p><p>In a recent case, Chinese authorities in July arrested&nbsp;Tara Zhang Yadi, a Chinese student who had been studying in France, upon her return to China. She faces up to 5 years in prison, or up to 15 if found to be a ringleader, under charges of “inciting others to split the country and undermine national unity,” because she advocated for Tibetan rights while in France. This arrest comes amid broader Chinese government efforts to demand that foreign institutions, including&nbsp;museums in France, refer to Tibet as Xizang, a Mandarin name for the region.</p><p>“Millions of people in China, France, and the EU continue to bear the weight of Beijing’s repression and abuses,” Jeannerod said. “Macron should stop trying to justify France’s silence on rights and make clear that the Chinese government’s repression affects many core French and EU interests, and that China needs to reverse course to maintain strong relations.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/france-macron-should-address-repression-in-china-visit,2,105.3188,61.524,2025-12-04T16:08:02.642287+00:00

<p>Two dozen humanitarian workers face trial on the Greek island of Lesbos this week on baseless felony charges that carry 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have hounded the humanitarians for seven years for saving lives at sea, while the European Parliament has&nbsp;called this “the largest case of criminalization of solidarity in Europe.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015,&nbsp;up to 10,000 asylum seekers and migrants were making the&nbsp;perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Lesbos per week.&nbsp;At least 805 people, including 271 children, died or disappeared in the Aegean Sea that year. Emergency Rescue Center International (ERCI), a small nonprofit, started search and rescue operations to support overwhelmed local authorities.</p><p>But in 2018, two of ERCI’s foreign volunteers were&nbsp;jailed for 107 days based on a flawed police report depicting rescue work as smuggling and espionage, despite a Hellenic Coast Guard official’s statement to the police that the group had regularly notified him when migrants’ boats were coming. Two Greeks were also later placed in pretrial detention. Human Rights Watch&nbsp;found the charges perversely misrepresent ERCI as a crime ring.</p><p>Instead of dropping the case, Greek prosecutors charged 24 people and blundered past basic due process requirements. Some defendants were&nbsp;reportedly never served. Other indictments were&nbsp;missing pages and written in Greek, which some foreign defendants did not understand.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, the prosecution filed&nbsp;misdemeanor charges against all the defendants but in the&nbsp;wrong court. One of the foreign volunteers jailed in 2018 was barred from re-entering Greece for her own trial. When the misdemeanor case&nbsp;was finally heard, it collapsed and&nbsp;all charges were dismissed.</p><p>The prosecution is now pursuing three felony charges. But after a years-long investigation found no new evidence, the case depends on deeply-flawed logic: saving lives at sea is mischaracterized as migrant smuggling (felony 1), so the search-and-rescue group is a criminal organization (felony 2), and therefore, the group’s legitimate fundraising is money laundering (felony 3).</p><p>The case is an acute example of a disturbing&nbsp;trend in Europe of criminalizing solidarity with people on the move. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders&nbsp;noted that rights defenders and humanitarian workers in Greece face the misuse of criminal law against them to a “shocking degree.”</p><p>An acquittal of the defendants will be the only just end to a perverse prosecution that should never have started.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/solidarity-on-trial-in-greece,0,-87.9238411,43.0408266,2025-12-04T16:08:04.141421+00:00

<p>(New York) – The arrest and return of an asylum seeker who took his children to the Club World Cup soccer tournament final on July 13, 2025, raises serious concerns about the safety of noncitizens attending the 2026 World Cup in the&nbsp;United States, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>In May,&nbsp;Human Rights Watch wrote to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the World Cup organizer, to express concerns about the risks and impact of US immigration policies on the 2026 World Cup and the 2025 US Club World Cup, recommending “immediate action” to address US policies that create risk and threaten FIFA’s ability to uphold its stated values of human rights, inclusion, and global participation.</p><p>FIFA&nbsp;responded on June 3, stating that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.” FIFA also said it would engage with relevant authorities if it becomes aware of human rights concerns.</p><p>But the incident at the Club World Cup final, uncovered by Human Rights Watch, illustrates the limitations of FIFA’s efforts to address the serious human rights risks noncitizens face at FIFA events.</p><p>“A father who loves soccer planned a special day with his children at a FIFA tournament, ended up detained for three months, and was then sent to a country where he said his life is at risk,” said&nbsp;Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “Under the Trump administration’s policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger.”</p><p>The man, whose name and country of origin are being withheld at his request, was detained in New Jersey before the Club World Cup tournament final between Chelsea (England) and Paris Saint-Germain (France). He was in the American Dream Mall parking lot near MetLife Stadium with two of his children, ages 10 and 14, waiting for the match to begin.</p><p>The man and his family members told Human Rights Watch that police questioned and then detained him after he attempted to fly a small drone to take a photograph of his family. When the drone malfunctioned, he put the drone back in his car and was detained as he was doing so.</p><p>A local ordinance&nbsp;prohibits the use of drones on or over the MetLife Complex, implementing a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directive against flying drones in and around stadiums during sporting events. Unintentionally violating the FAA prohibition is a civil offense and usually only results in a fine, according to an aviation lawyer consulted by Human Rights Watch.</p><p>The man said that the officer who questioned him initially told him they would issue him a citation and release him quickly. Instead, law enforcement officers asked about his immigration status and then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. ICE agents detained the man the same day and moved to deport him.</p><p>Interviewed in the detention facility, he told Human Rights Watch that his last memory of the day of his arrest was “seeing my kids cry because I was captured.” His children thought their father would be released to attend the match. But when one child checked his phone, he saw his father’s location was 40 minutes away, the man’s wife told Human Rights Watch.</p><p>People facing deportation have the right to ask for asylum. The family said they fled their country of origin in 2022 after armed groups threatened to kill them.</p><p>But the administration of President Donald Trump does not ordinarily allow release from immigration detention, even if asylum seekers can post bond, a sum of money to guarantee that they will continue to appear for deportation hearings.</p><p>After three months in immigration detention, the man decided not to appeal when the immigration judge denied his asylum claim. He told Human Rights Watch the prospect of being locked up longer left him in despair. “It’s so psychological what they do to you there.… You want to get out so badly.”</p><p>The Trump administration has frequently stated that immigration enforcement targets “the worst of the worst.” But&nbsp;research by Human Rights Watch and other groups has shown that people swept up in raids or apprehended in more targeted operations often have&nbsp;no criminal history.</p><p>Ahead of the Club World Cup kickoff, and in response to whether he had any concerns about ICE agents at the games, FIFA President Gianni Infantino&nbsp;said: “I don’t have any concerns … we want everyone who comes to the games to pass a good moment…. I’m sure this will be a great, great celebration.”</p><p>Especially in light of the Trump administration’s abusive immigration dragnet, state and local law enforcement agencies that do not have arrangements with ICE to conduct immigration enforcement should generally not ask about immigration status or hold people for ICE to investigate their status, Human Rights Watch said. Agencies that do have such arrangements, known as 287(g) agreements, should take note of their&nbsp;inherent abuses and abandon them. ICE should avoid detaining asylum seekers to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p><p>FIFA should call on US authorities not to target World Cup events for immigration enforcement, including through 287(g) arrangements, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The 2026 World Cup should be a celebration of soccer, not an immigration enforcement operation that destroys families and puts lives at risk,” Worden said.&nbsp;“This case illuminates the dire contradictions of the US preparing to welcome the world’s largest sporting event while simultaneously implementing policies to separate families and deport asylum seekers.”<br /><br />For more details, please see below.<br /><br />Since President Trump took office in January 2025, the US government has&nbsp;taken steps to limit access to legal pathways to seek asylum. Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;documented how US deportation policies have exposed deported immigrants to the risk of death and human rights abuse.</p><p>Immigration and other law enforcement authorities have dramatically scaled up the number of arrests and detentions since the beginning of the Trump administration, with large operations in major cities such as&nbsp;Los Angeles,&nbsp;New York,&nbsp;Washington, DC, and&nbsp;Chicago. Federal immigration officers have targeted&nbsp;Latino communities, carrying out raids and arrests based on people’s perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin.</p><p>The 2026 World Cup will take place in 11 US cities and areas, including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The World Cup final will take place at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the 2025 Club World Cup final took place.</p><p>From January 20 to October 15, ICE arrested at least 92,392 people in and around cities where World Cup games will be played, according to government data provided by ICE in response to a freedom of information request to the&nbsp;Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Human Rights Watch. This does not include arrests made by US Customs and Border Protection or other law enforcement agencies. Of all these arrests, 65.1 percent were of immigrants with no US criminal convictions, which closely tracks with&nbsp;nationwide trends.</p><p>In New Jersey, 73.8 percent of 5,331 ICE arrests were of noncitizens with no US criminal convictions. ICE raids have occurred in New Jersey, leading to the&nbsp;arrests of large numbers of people at their&nbsp;workplaces, including noncitizens and&nbsp;US citizens.</p>FIFA World Cup Match LocationICE Arrest Location by Area of Responsibility (AOR)State# of ICE arrests in 2025Percentage of all ICE arrests without US criminal convictionsAtlantaAtlanta AORGeorgia8,00767.6 %BostonBoston AORMassachusetts4,68281.1&nbsp;%DallasDallas AORTexas10,76466.8 %HoustonHouston AORTexas14,71258.1&nbsp;%Los AngelesLos Angeles AORCalifornia9,62454.5 %San Francisco Bay AreaSan Francisco AORCalifornia3,79851.2&nbsp;%Kansas CityChicago AOR, Detroit AOR, New Orleans AORKansas and Missouri3,30158.3 %MiamiMiami AORFlorida20,55267.9&nbsp;%New York CityNew York City AORNew York4,97473.8&nbsp;%East Rutherford, New JerseyNewark AORNew Jersey5,33173.8&nbsp;%PhiladelphiaPhiladelphia AORPennsylvania4,72768.9&nbsp;%SeattleSeattle AORWashington1,92063.7&nbsp;%Total--92,39265.1 %<p>Media&nbsp;reported that some fans who purchased tickets to the Club World Cup sold their tickets for fear of being arrested or detained at stadiums and eventually deported. Staff from Telemundo (a Spanish-language US news outlet), Miami’s mayor, and FIFA officials were at a World Cup boat party in Miami that was canceled when&nbsp;the vessel was boarded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Coast Guard and some attendees were asked to show documentation of their legal status.</p><p>According to online posts, DHS officers were present during Club World Cup matches outside&nbsp;Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta,&nbsp;Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles, and&nbsp;Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, and ICE planned to be present at&nbsp;Lumen Field in Seattle.</p><p>The impact of arrests and raids on communities where World Cup games will be hosted has been devastating. In New Jersey, people are afraid of going outside, families have lost breadwinners, and businesses are suffering, according to members of Estamos Unidos. “Nobody feels safe,” one member said. The presence of local police during some of the documented arrests often leads to community members feeling less safe and subsequently less likely to report crime if they fear that any encounter with police could lead to them being turned over to immigration.</p><p>Many immigrants, faced with detention and deportation, have opted for “voluntary departure” in part to avoid the legal bars on re-entering the United States that come with being deported. The number of immigrants who have left voluntarily in New York and New Jersey courts from July to October 2025 increased by 1,373 percent compared to the same period last year, according to an&nbsp;analysis by Documented New York, an immigration-focused news outlet. This increase followed a&nbsp;July 8 ICE policy that limited bond eligibility for immigrants in detention.</p><p>The man arrested near the World Cup event was detained in Delaney Hall, an immigration detention facility in Newark, where there have been media reports of&nbsp;poor treatment of detainees, lack of food, and&nbsp;unsafe conditions for visitors.</p><p>An immigration judge denied the father’s asylum claim in September. The father said that, traumatized by three months of detention and desperate to speak more regularly to his children, he decided not to pursue further legal action, despite his fear of returning to his country of origin. The family had to purchase air tickets for his “voluntary departure.”</p><p>Article 4 of FIFA’s Human Rights Policy&nbsp;states that “FIFA will strive to go beyond its responsibility to respect human rights, as enshrined in the UNGPs [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights], by taking measures to promote the protection of human rights and positively contribute to their enjoyment, especially where it is able to apply effective leverage to help increase said enjoyment or where this relates to strengthening human rights in or through football.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/us-ice-arrest-at-fifa-event-spotlights-dangers-for-world-cup,2,1.6166193,50.1269942,2025-12-04T16:08:05.514914+00:00

<p>Macheso is an emerging advocate for the rights of young people with disabilities in Malawi. She has played a key role in strengthening national and regional disability rights movements through her work with the Association of Persons with Albinism in Malawi (APAM), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Youth Parliament, the EU Malawi Youth Sounding Board, and the University of Malawi’s Disability Rights Clinic.</p>

<p>“We are absolutely thrilled about Hilda’s selection,” said&nbsp;Elizabeth Kamundia, disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “Her leadership advancing the rights of people with albinism in Malawi is both courageous and urgently needed. Hilda brings insight, compassion, and determination to her work, and her advocacy is a beacon of hope for people with disabilities facing discrimination and stigma across the region.”</p><p>Over the past several years, Macheso has contributed significantly to disability advocacy efforts in Malawi, including leading awareness campaigns, coordinating International Albinism Awareness Day events, and supporting youth-focused policy engagement through the EU Malawi Youth Sounding Board. She has also influenced disability rights policy at the regional level through her work with the 3rd SADC Youth Parliament, where she wrote and presented a regional report on youth with disabilities that informed parliamentary resolutions across Southern Africa.</p><p>Macheso brings a creative approach to rights-based community engagement. While at the University of Malawi’s Disability Rights Clinic, she helped replace traditional presentations with interactive theater activities that encouraged dialogue and reflection. By using storytelling, role playing, and performance, she has created safe spaces for communities to talk openly about disability, confront harmful stereotypes, and promote more inclusive attitudes.</p><p>She has also been a crucial partner to the Human Rights Watch ongoing research in Malawi documenting employment discrimination and economic disenfranchisement of people with albinism. As a translator and research assistant, she helped conduct interviews, facilitated coordination with local communities, and ensured respectful, accurate engagement with people with albinism who had experienced discrimination.</p><p>“I want people with albinism to be seen, valued, and included,” Macheso said. “We have rights, we have dreams, and we deserve real opportunities to learn, to work, and to live with dignity. This fellowship is a chance for me to grow as an advocate and bring stronger visibility and justice to my community.”</p><p>Macheso’s activism comes at a time when the rights of people with albinism face ongoing challenges in parts of Africa. People with albinism&nbsp;experience violence linked to harmful myths and superstitions, as well as entrenched&nbsp;discrimination in education, access to&nbsp;health care, and&nbsp;employment. These systemic barriers often leave people with albinism facing social and economic&nbsp;marginalization, struggling to stay in school, secure decent work, and participate fully in community life.</p><p>Macheso was selected from a competitive pool of candidates nominated by Human Rights Watch staff for their disability rights leadership. As part of her fellowship, Macheso will receive training in research, advocacy, communications, and fundraising from Human Rights Watch colleagues. The fellowship further provides opportunities to strengthen her networks with other organizations and advocates.</p><p>Human Rights Watch established the fellowship to honor the disability rights icon Marca Bristo, founder of&nbsp;Access Living and inaugural chair of the Human Rights Watch disability rights advisory committee. Bristo was a key advocate for the adoption of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and helped shape the Human Rights Watch disability rights strategy. She encouraged Human Rights Watch to actively involve people with disabilities in its work and to invest in the development of emerging disability rights activists.</p><p>Previous Marca Bristo fellows have continued to promote disability rights with added skills to do their work more effectively. The 2024/2025 fellow&nbsp;Benon Kabale and the 2023/2024 fellow&nbsp;Mariana Lozano&nbsp;briefed states parties to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities about promoting autonomy for people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities.</p><p>In March 2024, the 2022/2023 fellow&nbsp;Benafsha Yaqoobi&nbsp;received the International Women of Courage Award from the US Department of State for her extraordinary achievements advocating for the rights of women with disabilities in Afghanistan. As part of the 2021/2022 fellowship,&nbsp;Bryan Russell, a Peruvian activist for political rights, helped raise awareness in countries such as&nbsp;Mexico about the need for greater political representation of people with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Hauwa Ojeifo, Marca Bristo inaugural fellow in 2020 and founder of&nbsp;She Writes Woman, a movement that gives mental health a voice in Nigeria, received funding from Melinda French Gates to advance the health and wellbeing of women based on her achievements.</p><p>“Hilda represents exactly the kind of bold, community-rooted leadership the Marca Bristo Fellowship was created to support,” said Daisy Feidt, executive vice president of Access Living. “Her advocacy for people with albinism in Malawi is both powerful and necessary, and her voice will be an important addition to global disability rights movement. We are thrilled to welcome her as the next Marca Bristo Fellow.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/malawian-disability-rights-advocate-honored,2,-102.5528,23.6345,2025-12-04T16:08:05.515420+00:00

<p>(Nairobi) – The death in custody of a prominent&nbsp;Cameroon opposition leader, Anicet Ekane, should be impartially, promptly, and effectively investigated, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Ekane, 74, the leader of the African Movement for New Independence and Democracy (Mouvement africain pour la nouvelle indépendance et la démocratie, MANIDEM) party,&nbsp;died on December 1, 2025, at the State Defense Secretariat (Secrétariat d’État à la Défense, SED), a detention facility in the capital, Yaoundé. He was detained on October 24 on security charges in the aftermath of the disputed presidential election that&nbsp;confirmed incumbent president Paul Biya, 92, for an eighth term, sparking nationwide protests. Security forces&nbsp;responded to protests with use of excessive force and mass arrests of opposition members and protesters. Many of those arrested, like Ekane, were charged with trumped up security charges when, in reality, they were arrested for their criticism of the election.</p><p>“The death in custody of someone who had been detained for his political views raises serious concerns over respect for the rule of law, due process, and detainee rights in Cameroon,” said&nbsp;Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Ekane’s death may be an example of a broader systemic failure to protect the lives and dignity of people deprived of liberty in Cameroon.”</p><p>Ekane’s relatives and lawyers said that prior to the arrest, Ekane suffered severe respiratory distress, and that his health deteriorated rapidly while in detention. They said that despite repeated requests, he was denied proper medical care.</p><p>Cameroon’s authorities bear responsibility for Ekane’s death, as he was in their care when it occurred, and they have obligations to determine the cause of death, establish any liability, hold those responsible to account, and take steps to prevent any further detainee deaths, Human Rights Watch said. If his cause of death is linked to negligence or deliberately inflicted conditions including denial of medical care, those responsible need to be held accountable. Hundreds of other critics in jail across the country face circumstances and detention conditions similar to Ekane’s at the time of his death.</p><p>Ekane was arrested in Douala, Littoral region, and transferred to SED, a detention facility in Yaoundé where Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;documented routine use of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment. Authorities had&nbsp;charged Ekane with “insurrection” and “incitement to rebellion,” among others, accusations that his party said were politically motivated and linked to Ekane’s outspoken support for an opposition candidate, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, and rejection of the official results of the vote. His lawyers said Ekane was never taken before a judge, and his detention was arbitrary.</p><p>“He struggled breathing and was in a critical condition,” said Hippolyte Meli, Ekane’s legal counsel. “We had alerted the prison authorities, but he was neither transferred to a civilian hospital nor given necessary treatment, and his oxygen concentrator [which helped him breath] was confiscated at the time of his arrest.”</p><p>In a December 1 news release, Cameroon’s government spokesperson, René Emmanuel Sadi,&nbsp;said Ekane died “following an illness” and had received proper medical attention. On the same day, the head of the communication division of the Ministry of Defense, Captain Cyrille Serge Atonfack Guemo,&nbsp;said that an investigation had been opened to establish the circumstances of Ekane’s death.</p><p>On December 1, SED authorities took Ekane’s body to the morgue of the Yaoundé central hospital and informed Ekane’s family and lawyers that an autopsy was to be carried out on December 2. But Ekane’s lawyers formally&nbsp;requested the suspension of the autopsy because the two state-appointed forensic doctors designated to perform the autopsy were selected without the family’s consent, and the family was not consulted or permitted to have their own expert present.</p><p>Ekane’s death comes amid ongoing tensions over the post-electoral government crackdown. On October 26, the day before the Cameroonian Constitutional Council&nbsp;announced the election results, opposition-led protests broke out across the country. Police and gendarmes&nbsp;responded with tear gas and live ammunition to disperse crowds. International media citing United Nations sources&nbsp;said security forces killed 48 people during the protests. Opposition sources who spoke to Human Rights Watch&nbsp;put the death toll at 55.</p><p>The authorities have also&nbsp;detained hundreds of people, including minors, on various charges such as “hostility against the homeland,” “revolution,” and “rebellion,” offenses that lawyers say have been applied indiscriminately and are unrelated to the actual acts of protest.</p><p>Ekane’s death adds to a&nbsp;long record of&nbsp;deaths in custody in Cameroon, a pattern marked by&nbsp;torture,&nbsp;denial of medical care, and pervasive impunity, extensively documented by Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups.</p><p>In another example, on January 17, police&nbsp;arrested and detained 36-year-old Abdoul Wahabou Ndandjouma in N’Gaoundéré, in northern Cameroon. The next day, authorities notified his family that he had died. Ndandjouma reportedly suffered severe mistreatment during interrogation. His co-detainee reported hearing his “screams of pain” from an adjacent room.</p><p>The UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions provide that there shall be “thorough, prompt and impartial investigation[s]"" of all suspected cases of death in custody. The inquiry shall ""determine the cause, manner and time of death, the person responsible, and any pattern or practice which may have brought about that death. It shall include an adequate autopsy, collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence and statements from witnesses."" The detailed methods and findings of the investigation are to be made public, and the government should ensure that anyone identified by the investigation as having participated in an unlawful killing are brought to justice.</p><p>&nbsp;“To ensure that the promised investigation is independent and impartial, authorities should seek the support of international human rights experts within the United Nations or African Union,” Allegrozzi said. “The government should also ensure that all political detainees receive timely, adequate health care and full legal protections, and release all those unjustly detained.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/03/cameroon-prominent-opposition-leader-dies-in-custody,2,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-04T16:08:05.515858+00:00

<p>Since October 31, Trinh Ba Tu, a Vietnamese political prisoner, has been held alone in a dark cell, denied visitors and even any kind of light. Guards open the door briefly twice a day to deliver meals, the only human contact he is permitted.</p><p>Why such severe punishment? A few days earlier, Trinh Ba Tu had complained about the moldy, spoiled rice he and other prisoners were given to eat.</p><p>And in September, he and fellow political prisoners reportedly carried out a hunger strike to demand the “immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and detained activists in Vietnam” and to  “urge the State of Vietnam to uphold human rights fully and comprehensively and pave the way for the democratization of the nation.”</p><p>The ruling&nbsp;Communist Party of Vietnam maintains a monopoly on political power and allows no challenge to its leadership. The government currently holds at least 160 political prisoners, people imprisoned, typically for years, because they have expressed their criticism of the government and its policies.</p><p>Trinh Ba Tu, 36, is serving an eight-year sentence at Prison No. 6 in Vietnam’s Nghe An province because he criticized the Communist Party. It’s a family tradition. His mother,&nbsp;Can Thi Theu, is serving an eight-year sentence at Prison No. 5 in Thanh Hoa province. His older brother,&nbsp;Trinh Ba Phuong, is serving 10 years, and appealing a newly imposed additional 11-year  sentence.</p><p>The family has long engaged in protests and campaigns for human rights, land rights, and environmental protection, among other issues. The authorities have charged all of them “with conducting propaganda against the state” under article 117 of Vietnam’s penal code, a law the authorities have routinely used to crush dissent.</p><p>Vietnam’s international trade partners and donors have been so focused on the country’s booming economy that they have said little about systemic abuses of human rights. They should  press the Vietnamese authorities to immediately release Trinh Ba Tu and conduct a proper investigation into prison conditions to insure they meet international standards for food, water, and medical care.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/02/vietnam-should-end-abuse-of-imprisoned-critic,2,107.9650855,15.9266657,2025-12-04T16:08:06.965680+00:00

<p>(Beirut) – A Tunis Appeal Court on November 27, 2025, sentenced 34 defendants in the politically motivated “Conspiracy Case” to between 5 and 45 years in prison, according to defense lawyers, after three appeal sessions without the presence of the main defendants and fair trial guarantees. Three people were acquitted, including a defendant who has been arbitrarily detained since February 2023.</p><p>The following quote can be attributed to Ahmed Benchemsi, Middle East and North Africa communications director at Human Rights Watch:</p><p>“These harsh prison sentences stem from a gross distortion of the justice system and are only meant to silence dissent. Tunisia under Kais Saied is back to the darkest years of the Ben Ali era. The appeal process was rushed, the defendants were denied their most basic rights, starting with the right to be present in the courtroom during their own trial. The authorities must immediately overturn these unjust convictions and release all political detainees.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/11/28/tunisia-harsh-sentences-in-conspiracy-case-appeal,0,9.400138,33.8439408,2025-12-04T16:08:08.367062+00:00

<p>China’s government has long sought to silence dissent abroad, but recently there’s been a disturbing escalation: harassment through sexually explicit letters targeting activists outside the country.</p><p>Hongkongers Carmen Lau and Ted Hui are exiled activists who face arrest warrants back in Hong Kong under the draconian National Security Law. They revealed last week that anonymous individuals were distributing in the United Kingdom and Australia sexually explicit deepfakes depicting them and their families. While police investigations in both countries could not trace the origins of these images, after Lau went public, a Chinese government spokesperson defended the pursuit of “wanted fugitives” as “legitimate and reasonable.”</p><p>There is evidence that the Chinese government was directly involved in a similar case in 2024, when anonymous online accounts circulated threatening and sexually suggestive posts targeting the 16-year-old daughter of Deng Yuwen, a US-based critic of the Chinese government, that were subsequently traced back to China’s security agencies. These tactics appear to have surged in recent years: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank, noted the increasingly gendered nature of online harassment against critics of the Chinese government as early as 2022.</p><p>While not all online harassment can be traced to Beijing, the government’s actions against exiled critics—issuing baseless arrest warrants and bounties and publishing violent rhetoric in government outlets (such as calling activists the “black hands” that “need to be cut off”)—signal to the Chinese diaspora worldwide that these activists are enemies of the state. Such encouragement effectively paints a target on their backs for harassment, surveillance, and abuse.</p><p>Governments need to take effective steps against “transnational repression”—cross-border abuses against activists and their families. First, they should publicly condemn such acts, especially harassment designed to psychologically abuse, shame, and marginalize critics.</p><p>Second, they need to investigate cases thoroughly, track patterns of transnational repression, and establish reporting mechanisms for diaspora communities. The US and Australian governments have taken some of these actions; other governments should follow suit.</p><p>Third, governments should commit to transparency by regularly reporting on progress addressing transnational repression.</p><p>Finally, governments need to commit to prioritizing victims. Beyond a law enforcement response, authorities should provide resources to support victims’ digital security and mental health needs, so that those exiled may enjoy the same rights as everyone else in their new country and feel safe again.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/16/sexual-harassment-of-chinese-critics-abroad,2,104.1954,35.8617,2025-12-17T01:11:44.574337+00:00

<p>Last week, President Trump signed an&nbsp;executive order that proposes to challenge and dismantle a range of “cumbersome” artificial intelligence (AI) laws at state and city level in the US and replace them with a not yet defined national AI regulatory framework.</p><p>The move is supposedly an effort to “sustain and enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI.” But at what cost?</p><p>By attempting to void existing regulatory frameworks, the Trump administration is&nbsp;promoting a future in which many components of society are reliant on AI, but where accountability for the impact of these systems is further out of reach.</p><p>In an ideal world, a national regulatory framework governing AI would expand safeguards, transparency, and access to justice for people across the US who are harmed by algorithmic and automated systems, in a consistent and equitable way. But in the context of this administration, the reality is likely to be a regulatory vacuum.</p><p>Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has&nbsp;ripped up previous federal policies&nbsp;governing discriminatory AI,&nbsp;removed safeguards across government-held data, and given tech companies expansive&nbsp;access to sensitive personal federal data. It has also&nbsp;increased its financial&nbsp;and political stakes&nbsp;in the tech industry and&nbsp;appointed an industry leader with a personal interest in deregulation to oversee the government’s approach to AI.</p><p>We know that integrating algorithms and automation to any process&nbsp;creates particular risks to human rights. AI systems have led to the&nbsp;wrong person being imprisoned,&nbsp;workers mistakenly fired, and&nbsp;lives ended too soon, and without adequate accountability for the companies behind the tech. It is imperative that this technology is created and deployed with the utmost care.</p><p>Trump’s executive order won’t just impact AI either. It threatens to rescind federal support for internet connectivity infrastructure via the BEAD (Broadband Equity Access and Deployment) Program, and would withhold funding to states that do not revoke AI accountability laws. This could significantly restrict equitable access to affordable, reliable broadband internet services for many.</p><p>There are worthwhile, evidence-driven efforts to secure accountability for AI injustices.

<p>(Nairobi) – Militia fighters killed at least 22 civilians and injured many more in an attack in late November 2025 on a village in Kwamouth territory in western Democratic Republic of Congo, Human Rights Watch said today. Witnesses from the village of Nkana, about 75 kilometers northeast of Kinshasa, the national capital, said that militiamen with firearms and machetes carried out an apparent retaliatory attack linked to rising intercommunal tensions.</p><p>On November 23, at about 4 a.m., Mobondo fighters from the ethnic Yaka community attacked Nkana, witnesses said. The assailants moved house to house, killing mostly ethnic Teke villagers in their homes and as they attempted to flee. Villagers said the fighters had accused Nkana’s Teke of refusing to install a new Yaka customary chief and sent messages to some Teke before the attack saying they would be punished.</p><p>“The violence in Kwamouth is just one of many deadly ethnic conflicts in Congo,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The global focus on the peace accords in eastern Congo shouldn’t distract from the unchecked violence and injustice and the cycles of impunity in other areas.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people in November and December, including 5 witnesses, 6 relatives of victims, local medical personnel, and community leaders from Kwamouth territory in Mai-Ndombe province.</p><p>Starting in June 2023, the Mobondo militia, named for their mystical amulets and armed with machetes, knives, spears, bows and arrows, and hunting and military assault rifles, have attacked Teke villages, burned houses, and killed dozens of people.</p><p>For years, civil society activists, human rights groups, and traditional authorities have warned about the escalating presence and activities of ethnic militias. The recent violence echoes the intercommunal crisis Human Rights Watch documented between 2022 and 2023, when militias from the Teke and Yaka communities killed hundreds of civilians in waves of attacks in the region.<br /><br />The recent attack underscores the Congolese government’s failure to scale-up security in the area despite repeated warnings of violence, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“When they broke down my door, I ran with my grandson,” said a 70-year-old woman about the recent violence. “They shot at me several times. One bullet hit my foot, but I kept running. If I had stayed for one more second, they would have killed us.”</p><p>Another villager said that fighters shot at his family as they attempted to escape: “My mother was carrying my daughter on her back. The first bullet struck her [his mother] in the heart. The second pierced her ribs and hit my daughter in the stomach.” His mother died instantly and his 5-year-old daughter died in the hospital on December 5.</p><p>Human Rights Watch documented the deaths of 22 civilians, including 4 women and 4 children. Among those killed were two sons of the village’s customary chief, the local Red Cross president, and a provincial tax authority official. A Congolese army soldier, who was guarding the village along with a small marine contingent that fled across the Congo River when the attack began, was also killed. Villagers said relatives buried their family members after the attackers left the area. Others were buried by soldiers when they arrived in the village.</p>

<p>Medical staff in Maluku commune, in eastern Kinshasa, said that several patients arrived in critical condition, while other wounded civilians fled across the river to Congo-Brazzaville to seek treatment.</p><p>The attack forced hundreds of residents to flee toward Maluku or to cross into Congo-Brazzaville. Witnesses said that families tried to evacuate older people, the injured, and small children. The army has since tried to encourage villagers to return to Nkana, but many have refused and have thus lost access to their homes and fields, deepening an already precarious humanitarian situation.</p><p>Following the attack, Congolese authorities deployed military personnel to the area and announced an investigation into the killings. Residents said that a delegation of Teke community members traveled to Kinshasa carrying the bodies of victims to protest what they described as the government’s silence and inaction. Some lawmakers have called on the provincial assembly to adopt urgent measures to address the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Historically, Teke people have owned much of the land and customary titles in Kwamouth territory, a part of the Bateke Plateau (literally translated “the plateau of Teke people,”) which extends to the outskirts of Kinshasa. Over the years, members of the Yaka, Mbala, Suku, and other communities from neighboring Kwilu and Kwango provinces have formed the agricultural workforce for landowners in Kwamouth territory or have become farmers in return for a customary tax—which Teke farmers also pay—to Teke customary chiefs.</p><p>Mobondo militias have increased attacks since mid-2025, targeting villages along the Congo River, including Mbanzale and Mayala in June, an attack along national road 17 in August, and a September 2 attack in the Limpwobo forest zone. Despite periodic military deployments, no permanent government security presence has been established, leaving rural communities exposed to renewed attacks.</p><p>Congolese authorities should ensure a thorough and impartial investigation of those responsible for the militia attacks, Human Rights Watch said. They should also ensure that affected villagers receive medical and mental health support and that displaced people have access to shelter, food, and basic services.</p><p>The government should put into effect, with meaningful community participation, a demobilization program for Mobondo fighters announced on December 2 and convene an intercommunal peace forum for Mai-Ndombe province that was announced in September.</p><p>“Addressing the communal violence in western Congo requires justice and accountability, effective early warning systems, and a real commitment to breaking the structures that allow armed groups to flourish,” Mudge said. “Concerned governments and United Nations agencies should assist the Congolese authorities in making this happen.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/16/dr-congo-militia-massacres-civilians-near-kinshasa,8,23.8222636,-2.9814344,2025-12-17T01:11:49.463092+00:00

<p>In the latest crackdown on media freedom in Ethiopia, Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany’s international public broadcaster, said in a December 12&nbsp;statement that the Ethiopian Media Authority had permanently suspended two of its journalists.</p><p>The Ethiopian Media Authority, a government agency that has the power to sanction news outlets operating inside the country, sent DW a letter on October 23 announcing the temporary suspension of “all journalistic activities” carried out by nine of its Ethiopia-based correspondents. In a follow-up letter DW received last week, the&nbsp;media authority&nbsp;lifted the suspension of seven correspondents but permanently suspended two who were covering the war-torn Amhara and Tigray regions, alleging their “continued noncompliance with Ethiopian laws and professional ethics.”</p><p>In its statement in response to the suspensions, DW noted that the media authority did not provide specific examples of violations, but rather broadly alleged that the outlet’s reporting violated the country’s&nbsp;media and&nbsp;hate speech laws.</p><p>Suspending these journalists underscores the Ethiopian government’s hostility to independent scrutiny and critical reporting. For years, Ethiopian journalists have described the operating environment as one characterized by a climate of fear in which authorities regularly threatened, arrested, and detained them for publishing stories that exposed rights abuses or criticized the government.&nbsp;Dozens are now living in exile.</p><p>In the last five months alone, police have&nbsp;arrested at least six Ethiopian journalists, some of whom were held incommunicado or in prolonged detention without charge. In April, the government enacted changes to the&nbsp;media law, increasing executive control over the Ethiopian Media Authority and empowering it to regulate media houses and journalists in violation of Ethiopia’s regional and international obligations to uphold the right to freedom of expression.</p><p>The government’s move against DW will no doubt have a chilling effect on the country’s remaining space for independent media.</p><p>With ongoing armed conflicts in the&nbsp;Amhara and&nbsp;Oromia regions,&nbsp;growing hostility between the federal government and Tigrayan authorities as well as with neighboring Eritrea, and elections slated for June 2026, the need for critical, independent reporting has never been greater. The Ethiopian government should reverse course, urgently lift the suspension of the DW journalists, and end further attacks on the media.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/another-blow-to-media-freedom-in-ethiopia,4,-117.235953,32.8799668,2025-12-17T01:11:51.047723+00:00

<p>On December 13, Belarusian authorities released 123 prisoners following negotiations led by the US administration, which had agreed to lift sanctions on Belarusian potash. The majority were sent to Ukraine, and a group of nine to Lithuania. Most of those released had been prosecuted and imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of their human rights.</p><p>Among those released are&nbsp;Ales Bialiatski, the founder of the Belarusian rights group Viasna and 2022 Nobel Peace Prize co-laureate; another leading Viasna activist,&nbsp;Uladzimir Labkovich; the prominent opposition figures&nbsp;Maria Kalesnikava,&nbsp;Maksim Znak, and&nbsp;Viktar Babaryka;&nbsp;and the chief editor of the largest news outlet TUT.by,&nbsp;Maryna Zolatava.</p><p>Their release brings relief and joy to their families, colleagues, friends, and supporters. But the day was bittersweet for everyone who did not find the names of their loved ones on the lists. More than&nbsp;1,100 individuals remain behind bars also for no more than peacefully exercising their rights.</p><p>Among them are Viasna’s board member and human rights advocate Valiantsin Stefanovic, Viasna’s human rights activist and volunteers’ coordinator Marfa Rabkova, and Nasta (Anastasia) Lojka, a prominent human rights defender. All of them are serving&nbsp;draconian sentences in reprisal for their legitimate human rights work.</p>

<p>(New York) – The&nbsp;Hong Kong High Court’s conviction of Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily, is the latest marker of Hong Kong’s dramatic shift from respecting press freedoms to endorsing outright hostility toward the media, Human Rights Watch said today. The government should quash the baseless conviction and immediately release Lai.</p><p>On December 15, 2025, the High Court found Lai, 78, guilty of two counts of “conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign forces” under the draconian National Security Law, and one count of “conspiracy to publish seditious publications” under the Crimes Ordinance. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison.</p><p>“The conviction of Jimmy Lai on bogus charges after five years of solitary confinement is both cruel and a travesty of justice,” said&nbsp;Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Chinese government’s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticize the Communist Party.”</p><p>The court ruled that Lai was the “mastermind” of the alleged conspiracies in all three counts. It said that Lai had conspired with others to commit “foreign collusion” by engaging in “international lobbying” and urging foreign governments to impose “sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities” against the&nbsp;Chinese government through his writings, talk shows, and media interviews.</p><p>The court also ruled that Lai had conspired with the advocacy group Stand with Hong Kong, which organized overseas campaigns calling for sanctions against the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.</p><p>For the sedition charge, prosecutors claimed that 161 Apple Daily articles, including 33 by Lai, constituted seditious publications because they allegedly fueled public distrust and hatred toward the authorities. The court agreed with the prosecution, ruling that Lai used his “personal influence to carry out a consistent campaign with a view to undermine the legitimacy” of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.</p><p>Prosecuting someone for exercising their right to freedom of expression violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is incorporated into Hong Kong’s legal framework via the city’s de facto constitution, the Basic Law, and expressed in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. Hong Kong’s&nbsp;national security legal regime is incompatible with these human rights guarantees.</p><p>Six former Apple Daily executives and editors had previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in the same case. A hearing to consider mitigating circumstances is scheduled for January 12, 2026, with sentencing to follow. Under article 29 of the National Security Law, those convicted of “foreign collusion” of a “grave nature” face 10 years to life in prison, while others face 3 to 10 years. The “sedition” charge under the Crimes Ordinance carries a maximum of 2 years in prison.</p><p>Lai’s prosecution was marred by multiple serious&nbsp;violations of fair trial rights, including being tried by judges hand-picked by the Hong Kong government, denied a jury trial, subjected to prolonged pretrial detention, and barred from having counsel of his choice. In 2023, the High Court upheld the government’s decision to bar a British lawyer, Timothy Owen, from representing Lai. Authorities also&nbsp;denied Lai, a British citizen, consular access from the United Kingdom, in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which China is party.</p><p>Lai is already serving a 5-year and 9-month prison sentence on charges of “fraud” and “participating in an unauthorized assembly.” He suffers from diabetes and has been held in prolonged solitary confinement, a form of torture, since December 2020. His family has repeatedly raised&nbsp;concerns about his&nbsp;deteriorating health, including heart problems and signs of physical decline.</p><p>Since Beijing imposed the National Security Law on Hong Kong in June 2020, at least 14 independent media outlets have been shuttered, including Apple Daily in June 2021 and Stand News in December 2021. The two influential outlets were forced to close following high-profile police raids and arrests of their editors for national security crimes.</p><p>Two journalists for Stand News were&nbsp;convicted of “sedition” under the Crimes Ordinance in August 2024. The Hong Kong government has also repeatedly&nbsp;harassed the Hong Kong Journalists’ Association and journalists, demanding back taxes without any evident basis.</p><p>“Foreign governments should respond to the travesty of Jimmy Lai’s trial by pressing the Hong Kong authorities to quash the case and release him immediately,” Pearson said. “The Chinese and Hong Kong governments should pay a cost for their unrelenting efforts to muzzle Hong Kong’s press.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/hong-kong-jimmy-lai-convicted-on-bogus-national-security-charges,2,104.1954,35.8617,2025-12-17T01:11:51.048576+00:00

<p>Last week, the&nbsp;International Criminal Court (ICC)&nbsp;sentenced&nbsp;Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman (also known as Ali Kosheib), a former leader of Sudan’s “Janjaweed” militias, to 20 years in prison. It follows his&nbsp;conviction in October for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in&nbsp;Sudan’s Darfur region between 2003-2004. The long-awaited, landmark sentence is an important moment for victims and provides much needed hope amid the ongoing atrocities taking place in the country, which have been fueled by&nbsp;decades of rampant impunity.</p><p>Emotions were heightened in the courtroom as Ali Kosheib stood to hear his sentence, a moment that a representative from a Sudanese victims’ group in the room described to Human Rights Watch as “surreal.” That said, as another individual shared with me, it “barely begins to touch the mountains of pain” in which victims continue to suffer in Darfur and across Sudan.</p><p>Ali Kosheib has the right to appeal the conviction and the sentence decisions. The case will now move on to&nbsp;hearings on reparations, an important aspect of the ICC’s role in bringing redress</p><p>As Kosheib’s case reaches its final stages before the ICC it should bring renewed global attention for the need for justice across Sudan.</p><p>The current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been raging for more than two years and both warring parties continue to commit atrocity crimes across Sudan, including the RSF’s most recent wave of mass killings and other grave abuses in North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher. Earlier this year, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor&nbsp;signaled that it expects to request further arrest warrants based on its&nbsp;investigations into ongoing crimes.</p><p>Without justice, impunity will continue to fuel atrocities in Sudan, producing yet more generations of victims. The SAF-affiliated authorities should, without further delay,&nbsp;hand over the remaining ICC fugitives to the court, including former Sudanese president&nbsp;Omar al-Bashir and two other former Sudanese high-level officials.</p><p>On behalf of the victims, governments should back the ICC’s critical work in Sudan and call for the expansion of ICC jurisdiction to all of Sudan. They should also explore establishing an internationalized court for Sudan, and encourage cases to be brought against perpetrators in other countries under the principle of&nbsp;universal jurisdiction.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/icc-sentences-former-sudanese-militia-leader-to-20-years,2,44.7964914,41.732466,2025-12-17T01:11:52.437940+00:00

<p>Each year, Human Rights Watch reflects on progress in children’s rights worldwide. From better access to education to stronger protections in wartime, these are some highlights from 2025.</p>New&nbsp;data from the International Labour Organization and UNICEF found 20 million fewer children involved in child labor than in 2020.Malawi and Japan both abolished school fees in public secondary schools.

<p>(Nairobi) –The Rwandan forces and M23 armed group that captured the city of Uvira in South Kivu province, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, on December 10, 2025, have put civilians at grave risk of abuse, Human Rights Watch said today. These forces and the Congolese military and its allies should facilitate safe passage for civilians fleeing the fighting and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches all those in need.</p><p>Late on December 9, the M23 and Rwandan forces entered Uvira after week-long fighting that pushed out Congolese and Burundian military forces and a coalition of militias known as the Wazalendo. The use of attack drones, large caliber artillery, and other weapons resulted in at least 74 civilian deaths and 83 wounded, according to the United Nations and media reports. The UN said that about 200,000 people have fled the fighting, including over 30,000 who crossed into Burundi.</p><p>“The Washington Accords addressing the situation in eastern Congo have not resulted in greater security or access to assistance for civilians near Uvira in South Kivu,” said Clémentine de Montjoye, senior Great Lakes researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The warring parties are continuing to commit atrocities and hinder humanitarian assistance and should be held to account.”</p><p>The humanitarian situation in Uvira and its vicinity is dire. Hospitals and health centers have been overwhelmed at a time when humanitarian assistance has dropped because of lack of access and funding shortfalls. Refugees in Burundi told Human Rights Watch they were receiving little to no assistance. The UN World Food Programme has suspended its assistance across South Kivu. Rwandan and M23 authorities should guarantee access to items essential for people’s survival, such as water, food, and medicine.</p><p>UN and military sources told Human Rights Watch that several thousand Rwandan soldiers, including special forces, crossed the border into Congo in recent weeks.</p><p>During the first week of December, Rwandan and M23 forces captured towns and villages on the road to Uvira, including Luvungi, Mutarule, and Sange. Sources reported artillery shelling, attack drones, and other explosive weapons being used in the offensive. The United States told the UN Security Council on December 12 that “Rwanda has [recently] deployed multiple surface-to-air missiles and other heavy and sophisticated weaponry into North and South Kivu to aid M23.”</p><p>“The drones dropped bombs on the population and people’s houses,” said a 60-year-old man from Luvungi who fled to Burundi. “I saw people trying to flee the fighting or hiding in their houses killed, including children in Mutarule.”&nbsp;</p><p>Several explosions in the Sange town center killed at least 36 people, including civilians, based on videos verified by Human Rights Watch and a local human rights defender and media reports. UN and local sources told Human Rights Watch that the explosions were the result of drone attacks and internal fighting between the Congolese army and the Wazalendo.&nbsp;</p><p>A video filmed on December 7 shows more than 20 bodies strewn across a street near the main intersection. Some are in military uniforms, but most are in civilian clothing, and some appear to be children. A civil society source said a family of five was killed in one explosion, including children ages 13 and 15. Three videos filmed on December 9 show volunteers digging graves on the side of the main road about 30 meters from the location of the bodies.</p><p>On December 9, a radio journalist, Janvier Lwesho Nyakirigo, and his brother were killed in an explosion at their house in Kiliba, 11 kilometers north of Uvira, two local sources said.</p><p>Concerns for the safety of civilians in South Kivu have been heightened by rising tensions and grave violations of international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict. After capturing Goma and Bukavu, the provincial capitals of North and South Kivu, in early 2025, M23 fighters carried out widespread abuses, including summary executions, forced recruitment drives, and sexual violence. The M23 also unlawfully transferred Congolese citizens and Rwandan refugees to Rwanda.</p><p>Several human rights defenders and journalists in Uvira and newly occupied territories have expressed concern to Human Rights Watch that they will face retaliation for their work, as did others after the capture of Goma and Bukavu.</p><p>After the M23 took control of Uvira on December 10, their fighters committed abuses. On December 10, in Kasenga neighborhood, M23 fighters shot and killed two 25-year-old men in civilian clothing after accusing them of being Wazalendo fighters, relatives and witnesses said. The M23 fighters also detained and later executed a 57-year-old man after he refused to hand over his phone, a relative and witness said.</p><p>On December 11 and 12, M23 fighters continued to execute young men and suspected Wazalendo fighters, including apparently unarmed people in civilian clothing, based on several residents and&nbsp;media reports. When a relative of a man killed went to collect his body from Kavimvira neighborhood, he said he saw scores of bodies there, which a UN source confirmed.</p><p>Throughout 2025, Congolese soldiers and Wazalendo fighters have also summarily executed and committed sexual violence against civilians. Wazalendo fighters have also harassed, threatened, abducted, and restricted access to basic services for members of the Banyamulenge community in Uvira, who are South Kivu-based Congolese Tutsis, accusing them of supporting the M23.</p><p>Four Uvira residents said that Congolese soldiers and Wazalendo fighters harassed civilians and looted houses as they retreated from the city. On December 10, Wazalendo fighters summarily killed a member of the Banyamulenge community, Congolese army Lt. Munyakuru Mushambaro, in Kabindula neighborhood, military sources and a neighbor reported. “They started shooting at the door; he tried to escape but they shot him and killed him on the spot,” said the witness. “They began singing anti-Tutsi songs, saying ‘now a Rwandan is dead, he got what he deserved.’”</p><p>The offensive on Uvira came days after the signing ceremony of the US-brokered Washington Accords on December 4. While the accord and its economic framework call for some peacekeeping measures, such as the removal of Rwandan troops from Congo, the agreement’s broad commitments need to be enforced, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The United States, European Union, and African Union should increase humanitarian assistance and press the governments of Burundi, Congo, and Rwanda to prioritize protecting civilians, ensure humanitarian access, and provide safe passage for civilians seeking to flee the fighting. The US and EU should urgently adopt new targeted sanctions against Rwandan officials responsible for, or complicit in, violations of international law, while swiftly reviewing their cooperation with Rwanda—including in the security and minerals sectors—to ensure they are not fueling further abuses.</p><p>Governments should also press countries in the region to facilitate access to the newly created UN Commission of Inquiry on eastern Congo to carry out vital evidence collection and documentation. They should call for an end to the impunity and take action to ensure that commanders and officials responsible for serious human rights violations are held accountable.</p><p>On December 12, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the latest escalation in the conflict. The US delegation accused Kigali of being “intimately involved” in planning and executing the conflict and said Rwanda had at least 5,000 to 7,000 troops in eastern Congo before this latest offensive began, despite Rwanda’s denials.</p><p>Guarantors of the Washington Accords should go beyond condemnation and take strong action to enforce compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The situation facing South Kivu’s civilians is becoming increasingly perilous and the humanitarian needs are enormous,” de Montjoye said. “Unless those responsible for abuses face serious consequences, given the events of the past year, the worst may be yet to come.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/dr-congo-fall-of-eastern-city-puts-civilians-at-risk,8,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-17T01:11:52.438675+00:00

<p>On November 21, President Ilham Aliyev&nbsp;signed a decree establishing a new centralized digital platform that dramatically expends state surveillance powers. The system, known as the Centralized Information and Digital Analytics System (MİRAS), will be controlled by the State Security Service and fully operational by May 2026.</p><p>MİRAS is designed to consolidate public data from multiple state bodies— including the Special State Service for communications and information security, and the Interior Ministry—centralize its processing and storage, and provide security services with potentially unfettered access to this information. An explanatory document describing the system’s scope was briefly posted online and then removed, raising concerns about transparency and the breadth of data to be captured.</p><p>This new regulation authorizes MİRAS to collect and analyze a wide range of personal data, including identity documents, migration history, family information, health records, property and financial data, criminal and administrative records, and certain communications metadata. It allows the State Security Service to integrate these data sources and generate forecasts, risk assessments, and analytical reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Azerbaijan is a highly authoritarian state with a&nbsp;well-documented history of unlawful digital surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and activists. Past investigations have&nbsp;shown authorities’ use of internet traffic monitoring tools and spyware to monitor and intimidate critics. Against this backdrop, a centralized system that consolidates sensitive personal data across sectors and institutions—without strong, independent oversight—poses serious risks of arbitrary or disproportionate surveillance.</p><p>As a member of the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, including Article 8 on the right to privacy. The European Court of Human Rights has&nbsp;repeatedly&nbsp;held that surveillance measures must meet strict standards of legality, necessity, and proportionality, and include independent oversight, transparent rules, and effective remedies.</p><p>The MİRAS regulation lacks these safeguards. It does not specify when or how personal data may be accessed, requires no judicial or independent authorization, and provides no retention limits, minimization standards, or external audit mechanisms. It centralizes control entirely within the State Security Service and includes no public reporting or procedures for individuals to access or correct their data.</p><p>Azerbaijan should suspend implementation of MİRAS and adopt robust privacy protections. International partners, including the Council of Europe, should press the authorities to ensure that supposed digital governance reforms do not entrench unchecked surveillance powers.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/azerbaijans-surveillance-platform-risks-sweeping-privacy-violations,2,3.1709315,36.7056347,2025-12-17T01:11:53.841831+00:00

<p>(Beirut) &nbsp;– The Israeli military’s repeated attacks on reconstruction-related equipment and other civilian facilities in southern Lebanon throughout 2025 violate the laws of war and are apparent war crimes, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Residents and local municipal authorities told Human Rights Watch that the attacks have hampered reconstruction efforts and the ability of tens of thousands of displaced people to return to their homes in southern Lebanon. Over 10,000 buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed there between October 2023 and January 2025.</p><p>“Amid the ceasefire, Israeli forces have carried out attacks that unlawfully target reconstruction-related equipment and facilities,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “After reducing many of Lebanon’s southern border towns to rubble, the Israeli military is now making it much more difficult for tens of thousands of residents to rebuild their destroyed homes and return to their towns.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch investigated four attacks on reconstruction-related sites, including three on six outdoor showrooms and maintenance facilities for bulldozers, excavators, and heavy-machinery in the southern Lebanese towns of Deir Seryan, Msayleh, and Ansariyeh, as well as an attack on a cement and asphalt factory in Sinay. The strikes, between August and October 2025, months after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, killed 3 civilians and injured at least 11 people.</p><p>Researchers visited the sites and interviewed 13 people, including owners of the storage and maintenance facilities, mayors of the towns, a manager at the cement and asphalt factory, a government contractor, and three people working at an international nongovernmental organization providing aid in southern Lebanon. Human Rights Watch also reviewed inventory documents and contracts provided by three site owners.</p><p>The four attacks destroyed over 360 heavy machines, including bulldozers and excavators, in addition to an asphalt and cement factory. Owners of heavy machinery sites said that they sold or rented machinery throughout various areas of Lebanon, and that some of the machines that they sold or rented were used for civilian reconstruction efforts, including rubble clearing.</p><p>“We can’t even clear the rubble [from our sites] because we’re afraid that, if we clear it, more of the machines we’re using for rubble-clearing might be struck,” said Ibrahim Karim, owner of a site in Deir Seryan.&nbsp;“So here, we’ve moved the rubble with our own hands.”</p><p>For each of the attacks, Israeli forces had issued statements that the equipment and materials were used by Hezbollah or “allowed,” “enabled” or were “intended” to be used by Hezbollah to “rebuild” or “reestablish” its “assets,” “activity,” or “infrastructure,” without revealing any details.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets in and around the sites. Researchers were able to verify that some of the machinery and supplies were being utilized for civilian purposes. Researchers were unable to verify the use of all machinery and materials that were attacked but did not find any evidence of their use for military purposes by Hezbollah.</p><p>Owners and employees all said that they did not know whether they were working with Hezbollah’s military wing. They said that they do not typically ask clients for their political affiliations and that they sell and fix heavy machinery to whoever requests their services.</p><p>Hezbollah has both a military wing (known as the Islamic Resistance, or al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya) and nonmilitary organizations, such as its political party, its healthcare institutions, and its social welfare organizations. Like other Lebanese political parties, Hezbollah has thousands of members who are not actively involved in any aspect of its military operations.</p><p>However, even in instances in which civilian equipment was being sold or maintained for people with links to Hezbollah, that would not in itself make the sites or the machinery legitimate military targets.</p><p>Based on the evidence Human Rights Watch gathered, the possible contributions that the targeted machinery and sites may have been able to confer on Hezbollah’s military capability is too vague or tenuous to make these objects lawful targets. Permitting such attacks could effectively make all heavy machinery and factories producing materials for construction military objectives subject to attack.</p><p>Israeli forces have also repeatedly carried out unlawful attacks on heavy machinery for reconstruction and other vital civilian infrastructure and hampered reconstruction efforts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p><p>Human Rights Watch sent a letter outlining its findings and posing questions to the Israeli military on December 3. The Israeli military responded with a question, which Human Rights Watch responded to, but subsequently the Israeli military did not provide any further response to the questions posed.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ authoritative study of customary laws of war provides that warring parties can only target legitimate military objectives: that is, objects that by their nature, location, purpose or use “make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”</p><p>The mere possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution for military purposes, such as to build fortifications, does not constitute a legitimate military target. Individuals who order deliberate attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure are responsible for war crimes.</p><p>Israel’s key allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, should urgently act to press Israel to cease all attacks on civilian objects and reconstruction-related efforts, including by immediately suspending military assistance and arms sales to Israel and imposing targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in grave crimes. Lebanon’s judicial authorities should initiate domestic investigations of serious international crimes, and the government should accede to the International Criminal Court’s Rome Statute and submit a declaration accepting the court’s jurisdiction prior to the date of accession, including since at least October 7, 2023.</p><p>“The return of tens of thousands of Lebanon’s displaced residents to their homes and villages hinges upon the ability of governments to press Israel to halt its attacks on reconstruction efforts,” Kaiss said. “They should immediately suspend arms to Israel and impose targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in ongoing grave crimes.”</p><p>Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect in November 2024, more than 64,000 people in Lebanon remain displaced. Ongoing Israeli strikes have killed at least 127 civilians since the ceasefire, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and have destroyed civilian infrastructure. According to UN experts, there have been “four incidents of projectiles fired from Lebanon toward Israel since the ceasefire, none of which resulted in casualties.”</p><p>The owners of two sites said that they had sold some machines to international organizations, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), or to municipalities that were funded by donations from UNDP and USAID. At two of the sites, researchers found remnants consistent with a US-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit, including a tail fin remnant with markings displaying a CAGE code for Boeing and a JDAM tail unit assembly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />In addition to the attacks Human Rights Watch documented, other media outlets have reported additional Israeli strikes that, they said, have destroyed reconstruction equipment and efforts. Public Works Studio, a Lebanese research and design studio working on issues related to reconstruction, housing, and public spaces, said that between December 2024 and November 2025, the Israeli military conducted 46 attacks on vehicles working to remove rubble and clear roads in southern Lebanon, 32 attacks on prefabricated rooms and houses set-up by residents returning to their villages, and 6 on concrete mixers, quarries, stone and aluminum factories, and wood sawmills.</p><p>On November 25, the spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Israeli forces had “severely hampered reconstruction efforts and attempts by internally displaced people to go back to their homes in southern Lebanon,” including through attacks on the cement and asphalt factory. He said that Israeli attacks have “destroyed and damaged civilian infrastructure, including housing units, roads, factories and construction sites,” and that Israel’s recent construction of a wall, which crosses into Lebanese territory, has “affect[ed] people’s right to return to their lands.”</p>Deir Siryan: August 6, 15 Machines

<p>On the night of August 6, 2025, Israeli forces struck two bulldozer maintenance facilities in Deir Seryan in southern Lebanon. The strikes killed one person, a Syrian worker at one of the sites, and injured two others, according to the owners and Lebanon’s&nbsp;Ministry of Health.</p><p>Researchers visited the two sites on November 21 and observed destroyed bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery, as well as damaged homes. Human Rights Watch spoke to the owners of the two sites, Ibrahim Karim and Hussein Khalil Karim, who are cousins, as well as Ibrahim’s nephew, Hussein Mohammed Karim, who works with him.</p><p>Both Ibrahim and Hussein Khalil own several heavy machines, including bulldozers, excavators and cement rollers that they rent out to municipalities and private individuals working in construction and agriculture. They also own hundreds of spare parts that they use to fix machines that others bring to them. The strikes damaged all of their machinery and spare parts, as well as about a dozen machines owned by others that were on site for maintenance. The strikes also destroyed their personal vehicles and damaged their homes.</p><p>They estimated the damage to the machines and spare parts at US$1.3-1.4 million.</p><p>At one of the sites, researchers found remnants of a Boeing-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail unit assembly.</p><p>Ibrahim said that most of their clients were from the South Lebanon Council, a government entity established in 1970 to carry out projects aimed at “meeting the needs of [southern Lebanon] and providing means of safety and stability.” He said that individuals had also been renting their machines to remove rubble from destroyed villages, which he had witnessed as he had gone to check on the machines while they were rented out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“When we rent our machines, we go almost every day to check on them, to fill them with diesel, and fix any issues with them,” Ibrahim said.</p><p>The Syrian worker killed was living in the bottom floor of Khalil’s home. The strike also injured Ibrahim’s wife and brother Hussein Khalil, who were both at their homes. Six children, ages 5-12, were at one of the homes, Ibrahim said. “Our house is 40 meters away from the site,” he said.&nbsp;“My wife was injured as a result of the shattering glass.”</p><p>Hussein Khalil, Ibrahim, and Lebanese media all reported that that the initial strikes were followed by others.</p><p>“When the strikes happened, I was nearby in the village on my motorcycle and heard the strikes that happened on our place and our cousin’s place,” Hussein Khalil Karim said. “I quickly came with my motorcycle, and I took my sister from the house and dropped her off in the neighboring village. And then I came back and saw that there were additional strikes on the machines. One of the strikes “hit a bulldozer and the metal shrapnel from the missile killed a Syrian worker.”</p><p>He said that the strikes had destroyed 14 heavy machines at his site, including excavators, bulldozers, six-wheeler trucks, and pick-up trucks, in addition to spare parts used in maintenance operations.</p><p>The day of the strike, the Israeli military&nbsp;stated&nbsp;on its Telegram channel that its forces had “struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in southern Lebanon,” including “Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, a missile launcher and Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure which stored engineering tools that allowed for the reestablishment of terrorist infrastructure in the area.” The statement did not specify whether it was referring to the attacks in Deir Siryan.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets at or around the site, and the possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution to military purposes does not in itself make it a legitimate military target.</p>Ansariyeh: September 3, 46 Machines

<p>At about 10:00 p.m. on September 3, the Israeli military struck a heavy machinery showroom and maintenance facility in the southern Lebanese village of Ansariyeh, destroying 46 heavy machines, including bulldozers and excavators, in addition to hundreds of spare parts, according to the owner. While 12 of the destroyed machines belonged to Mohammed Kiniar, the owner, the rest belonged to customers who had sent their machines for repair, he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A building on the site had been hit by Israel a year earlier, on September 27, 2024, Kiniar said.</p><p>Researchers visited the site on November 21 and observed dozens of destroyed bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery, as well as hundreds of spare parts and equipment used to restore machinery. The owner said that machinery destroyed in the September 3, 2025, strike included agricultural bulldozers, smaller “Bobcat” bulldozers, and excavators.</p><p>A Syrian man was killed in the strike, said Kiniar and the mayor of the town, Abbas Fakih, and three people were lightly injured.</p><p>Fakih and Kiniar both said that the strike happened just over an hour after workers at the site had finished unloading two containers of Bobcat bulldozers and other spare parts that the company had imported to Lebanon. The day of the strike, workers had also been repairing bulldozers belonging to the Zahrani Union of Municipalities, which includes 15 municipalities, in addition to an excavator belonging to another Lebanese contractor, Kiniar said.</p><p>“That day we heard drones over our head the entire day,” the mayor said. “We heard two different drones. The drones must have seen them emptying the containers.”</p><p>At the site, researchers saw dozens of burned or damaged bulldozers, excavators and spare parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiniar said that the strikes destroyed 46 heavy machines, with damages amounting to $3.6 million. He said that he established the site in 2003 and has sold various heavy machinery to international organizations, such as UNDP and municipalities, and has repaired heavy machinery for government contractors and a UN peacekeepers battalion.</p><p>“I’m a trader,” Kiniar said. “I sell to everyone, and I try to fix every machine that comes here. My customers come from all over Lebanon.”</p><p>On November 21, Human Rights Watch spoke to a Lebanese contractor and owner of the contracting company South for Construction S.A.L., Riad al-Assaad, who had sent an excavator to the site for repairs two days before the site was struck.

<p>Israeli forces struck several sites containing bulldozers, excavators, “Bobcat” bulldozers, and other machinery in Msayleh in the middle of the night on October 11. The strikes killed one person, a Syrian national, and injured&nbsp;seven others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lebanon’s&nbsp;National News Agency reported that just after 4:00 a.m. on October 11, “more than 11 strikes directly targeted a group of bulldozer and excavator showrooms” resulting in “the destruction of more than 300 vehicles, including bulldozers and excavators, among them more than 100 small ‘Bobcat’ vehicles.” The agency reported that the five sites that were completely destroyed “are considered among the largest machinery showrooms in Lebanon” and that five other separate sites were also damaged from the attacks.</p><p>On November 14, Human Rights Watch researchers visited four of the outdoor showrooms and interviewed the four owners, including Ahmad and Imad Tabaja, a father and son who said they lost 139 machines and spare parts worth a total of about $4.7 million in the attack, as well as the owners of two other showrooms targeted.</p><p>At the two plots owned by the Tabaja family, Human Rights Watch saw dozens of machines and hundreds of spare parts that had been completely destroyed in the attack. Most machines were completely burned and their metal had been warped by the blast. At one of the family’s sites Human Rights Watch also found weapons remnants and determined that they were consistent with a JDAM guidance kit assembled and sold by a US company.</p><p>Researchers reviewed documents provided by the owners, including a detailed inventory of 139 destroyed pieces of equipment, among them heavy machines, generators and various spare parts, and the owners’ estimates of damages.</p><p>Ahmad Tabaja, the father, said that he has imported machines for use in the agricultural sector, including tractors, excavators, rollers, and bobcat bulldozers since 1967.</p><p>He and his son, Imad, said that their clients have included government contractors working with the Energy and Water Ministry and the Public Works Ministry, as well as municipalities. He said that UN agencies and USAID had provided the funding for some municipalities to purchase equipment from them. Researchers also reviewed receipts issued by the Tabaja family company, between 2018 and 2025, for heavy machinery and spare parts purchased from the site by municipalities, Lebanese and international companies, in addition to the US-based Near East Foundation.</p><p>Imad said that they sold equipment across all of Lebanon, but that since October 2023, much of their sales had been to individuals and contractors outside of southern Lebanon due to hostilities there. Ahmed added that about 10 percent of their sales were also international.</p><p>“All our shipment containers have come in legally through customs,” Imad said. “The government typically estimates the price of each imported container. In total, the price of our imports is $4.7 million. Everything was destroyed [in the strikes].”</p><p>The owner of another site, Ali Tarhini, said that eight of his ten six-wheeler trucks were completely destroyed, and two partially destroyed, in the strikes, resulting in between $400,000 to $500,000 in losses. “I’ve been working in this business for nearly 30-35 years, and I’ve been in Msayleh for 4 years,” he said. “I just sell to regular people. Whoever comes and wants to buy [trucks], we sell to them.”</p><p>Another owner, Mohammed Chahine, showed researchers the damage on his site, which borders the Tabaja family’s site. Chahine provided an inventory of the damages at his site, including three damaged hydraulic winches, used in digging and preparing water wells, in addition to a car, a prefabricated house, submersible water pumps, generators, solar panels, lithium batteries and spare parts, which totaled $770,000 in losses.</p><p>Chahine said that he has been working at this site in Msayleh since 1990 and has worked with municipalities, government contractors, the South Lebanon Council, and the South Lebanon Water Establishment, the public utility responsible for supplying water across southern Lebanon. On the site, researchers found damaged vehicles, solar panels, a container that stored salvaged spare parts for solar panel systems, in addition to a hangar where Chahine stored other spare parts for the hydraulic winches.</p><p>The Israeli military&nbsp;stated on Telegram on the day of the strike that its forces had “struck and dismantled Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of southern Lebanon, where engineering machinery used to reestablish terrorist infrastructure in the area they were located."" The statement did not specify whether it was referring to the attacks in Msayleh.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets at or around the site, and the possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution to military purposes does not in itself make it a legitimate military target.</p>Sinay: October 16, Cement and Asphalt Factory

<p>Israeli forces attacked a large cement and asphalt factory in Sinay on October 16. The factory was established in the village in 1992, and was reportedly one of the&nbsp;largest cement factories in Lebanon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch researchers visited the factory on November 14 and spoke with a manager. Human Rights Watch also interviewed the mayor of the town.</p><p>Researchers walked through the area and observed several areas at the site that were either destroyed or significantly damaged, including an administrative building, cement silos, crushers, an asphalt mixing factory, and dozens of destroyed vehicles, including concrete mixer trucks, excavators, pick-up trucks, and bulldozers.</p><p>The attack, which consisted of over 10 strikes according to both the mayor and the administrative manager, destroyed the whole industrial area, approximately 70,000 square meters and included an asphalt factory, a cement factory, and 50 machines on the factory’s premises, including bulldozers, excavators, crushers, concrete mixers, pumps, and cement trucks. According to both the mayor and the administrative manager, the cost of the destruction totaled over $10 million.</p><p>“After the ceasefire we had about a 30 percent increase in our work, probably all related to reconstruction,” the manager at the site said. “But we don’t ask people why are you buying this cement or this asphalt. We just sell it to them.</p><p>He said that the factory’s clients include contractors, the Public Works Ministry, municipalities, and individuals working on construction projects. He said that their cement and asphalt had been used to build the village school and much of the public infrastructure in a neighboring village.</p><p>The factory employed about 60 people from the area who the manager said were all “directly affected” by the strikes as the factory shut down.</p><p>In a statement published on&nbsp;October 16, the Israeli military said that Hezbollah “produced cement to rebuild and reestablish its assets and terrorist infrastructure that were struck and dismantled” and that the “infrastructure enabled Hezbollah's continuous activity and the reestablishment of its terrorist activity under civilian disguise in Lebanon.” The statement did not specify whether it was referring to the attacks in Sinay.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets at or around the site, and the possibility that materials could be used in an undefined, future contribution to military purposes does not in itself make it a legitimate military target.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/15/lebanon-israel-unlawfully-destroying-reconstruction-equipment,10,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-17T01:11:53.843213+00:00

<p>(Sydney) – A summer Sunday evening at Sydney, Australia’s Bondi beach turned into a terrifying nightmare as two gunmen opened fire on people celebrating the first night of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.&nbsp;Sixteen people have been confirmed dead, including one of the shooters, with at least&nbsp;42 injured. A second assailant was taken into custody.</p><p>“An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian,” said Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&nbsp;last night at a press conference. “Australia will never submit to division, violence or hatred.”</p><p>Strong political leadership is vital in ensuring everyone can live in safety and practice their religious beliefs. The actions needed to address intolerance and counter violent extremism will be a key debate in Australia for days and weeks to come.</p><p>The Bondi attack is the&nbsp;deadliest mass shooting in Australia in three decades, after the&nbsp;1996 Port Arthur Massacre, which led to significant changes in Australia’s gun laws. The&nbsp;National Firearms Agreement is broadly regarded as one of the major achievements of then-Prime Minister John Howard’s term. The legislation banned semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and imposed strict national licensing requirements.</p><p>The attack comes after an&nbsp;increase in antisemitic hate crimes in Sydney. In the span of two weeks this past January, there was an&nbsp;arson attack and antisemitic graffiti on a childcare center in the suburb of Maroubra near a Jewish school and synagogue,&nbsp;two synagogues were defaced with swastikas, and the former home of a prominent Jewish community leader was set ablaze and four cars were destroyed.</p><p>Rights-respecting intelligence gathering and police work are key to protecting people in the most direct, physical sense. But tackling the motivations underlying hate crimes requires much more. They underscore the need for the Australian government to strengthen anti-racism community initiatives, as well as investing in education and community dialogue to combat prejudice. Politicians should not exploit this tragedy to sow further hate or division.</p><p>Authorities at the community, state, and national level should invest substantially in efforts to counter threats or acts of incitement, the spreading of hateful content online and harmful misinformation, and to promote inclusiveness and respect for all communities in Australia.</p><p></p><p></p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/14/australia-beach-shooting-a-heinous-attack-on-jewish-community,6,134.755,-24.7761086,2025-12-17T01:11:55.363580+00:00

<p>(Beirut) –&nbsp;Qatari government clients and other major businesses are failing to pay contractors on time for projects, leaving migrant workers unpaid, Human Rights Watch said today. Subcontractors and others in the supply chain are also affected and themselves shortchange workers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Clients at the top of the Qatari contracting supply chain, including government bodies, often have impunity, leaving subcontracting businesses that employ migrant workers bearing the cost,” said&nbsp;Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Influential contractors and employers in Qatar should stop stiffing workers by failing to pay subcontractors what they owe.”</p><p>Between February and March 2024 and in September 2025, Human Rights Watch interviewed 16 people who had been employed by Qatar labor supply companies. Human Rights Watch also reviewed contractual agreements and email correspondence from two subcontractors. One employed thousands of migrant workers, including for Qatari government agencies and large-scale construction companies. The other was a labor supply company. Names of those interviewed are withheld because they fear retaliation.&nbsp;</p><p>Documents reviewed showed that both subcontractors struggled to pay workers when their clients did not release payments as contractually obligated. Multiple attempts by one to demand payment, including threats of legal action, did not yield payment, causing knock-on effects throughout the subcontracting chain. &nbsp;</p><p>When clients do not make timely payments, they may be complicit in contributing to wage theft against migrant workers, as many companies do not have the financial resources to pay workers until they themselves are paid. Human Rights Watch reviewed contracts specifying payment within 45 days of invoice submission, but payments had been delayed by almost a year.&nbsp;</p><p>“Non-payment by clients has badly affected our cash flow, as we couldn't pay our suppliers and subcontractors that we have engaged in our project,” a subcontracting company representative said. “We are also facing legal threats from them. The company has not been able to pay its own workers’ salaries either.”&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed letters supporting this claim, including those sent to clients that laid out the adverse outcomes and requested payment, as well as letters to downstream suppliers attempting to justify the payment delays, requesting payment extensions, and urging them to pause any legal proceedings.</p><p>Interviews revealed that when demands for payment via written notices, letters, or client visits don’t work, subcontractors consider legal remedy. Yet these avenues do not always yield positive results, and powerful clients even dismiss warnings from contractors about initiating legal action, Human Rights Watch found.&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;documented that a “pay when paid” clause included in contracts can contribute to wage theft, and Qatar should instead extend liability for wages beyond the immediate employer in subcontracting chains. In addition to payment delays, interviews revealed that the underutilization of days or personnel compared with what is contractually agreed upon and project extensions or changes to the scope of a project without corresponding increases in budget also harm workers.</p><p>Multiple workers employed by at least five labor supply companies said that their management often delayed their wages and told them that they would be paid once the client company pays them. “The [client] company did not care until we stopped showing for work because we went on strike,” a worker said.&nbsp;</p><p>In other cases, however, labor supply companies may not pay even when paid by the client company, highlighting the need for strict oversight. One letter reviewed showed that the client company demanded that a subcontractor pay their workers after workers complained to them directly.</p><p>Client companies have enormous power over labor supply companies’ business practices that they contract with, enabling abuses when they fail to conduct proper due diligence. Businesses have&nbsp;responsibilities to uphold human rights throughout their operations. Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Labor supply companies are at the bottom of often long and complex subcontracting chains. Human Rights Watch research in Gulf states has found that migrant workers employed by labor&nbsp;supply companies often face more abuses than those directly hired by companies. “Even when we are doing identical work, the company hires were paid almost double our salary,” one worker said. “How can we justify that?”&nbsp;</p><p>Labor supply companies sometimes submit low bids and keep overall operating costs low by paying low wages. Clients often do not inquire about wages paid in their subcontracting chains, interviews revealed. “It would have been better if the client company set a minimum salary out of the lump sum amount they pay per worker,” a worker said.</p><p>Workers described terrible living and commuting conditions at labor supply companies. “Even though my [work] duty started at 6:00 a.m., I had to wake up at 2:00 a.m., because the company adjusted schedules.” a worker said. “They dropped us at our site 90 minutes early to accommodate for other workers’ schedules.”&nbsp;</p><p>Workers said they lived in overcrowded rooms and had inadequate water and electricity access and unhygienic restrooms. One worker lost 55 pounds in his first year working in Qatar due to the physically demanding work and the inedible food. He said, “Nothing was fresh. The chicken had blood in it.”</p><p>Another worker said, “From [the client’s] perspective, they have basically bought us… and try to squeeze us to the maximum.” This was reflected in a contract between a contractor and labor supply company reviewed by Human Rights Watch, which reads: “[Labor Supply Company] will supply the required manpower, taking production from the workers and utilizing them to the maximum is the responsibility of [Client Company].”&nbsp;</p><p>Neither the bare-bones contract nor the bid specified standards for meals, accommodation, transportation, or any other human rights obligations of either party. The incomplete contracts also explicitly breached the labor law by setting minimum daily hours worked at 10 instead of 8. Even when work is irregular, employers did not allow workers to transfer jobs and instead told them to leave the country and come back on a new visa, workers said.</p><p>In migrant communities, “labor supply companies” are viewed as a risky choice. However, aspiring migrant workers are often misled by recruiters to believe that they are direct hires or are unable to distinguish supply companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the International Labour Organization conventions&nbsp;ratified by Qatar, including the Forced Labor Convention (No. 29), withholding and non-payment of wages is a coercive practice that may amount to forced labor.&nbsp;</p><p>Under Qatar’s Civil Code, subcontractors and workers can claim payment directly from the client if the contractor fails to pay.</p><p>Qatari authorities should hold major companies responsible for labor abuses committed by subcontractors and labor supply companies. All businesses should uphold worker protections across their operations and supply chains.</p><p>“Qatari authorities are failing twice over to protect migrant workers, first as clients themselves fail to pay contractors for work on time and second as ineffective regulators,” Page said. “Highly touted systems like the Wage Protection System and the Wage Support and Insurance Fund are insufficient to prevent and remedy rampant wage theft.”&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/14/qatar-failure-to-pay-contractors-harms-migrant-workers,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-17T01:11:55.364110+00:00

<p>(New York) – Chinese authorities have formally charged well-known journalist and author Du Bin (杜斌) with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” Human Rights Watch said today.&nbsp;</p><p>Police in Beijing took Du, 53, into custody on October 15, 2025, a day before he had scheduled trip to Japan, his sister said in a statement. He has since been held at Beijing’s Shunyi Detention Center. He faces up to 5 years in prison under article 293 of China’s Criminal Law, and up to 10 years if found to be “seriously disrupting public order.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The baseless charges against a prominent journalist like Du Bin highlight the growing intolerance for dissent under Xi Jinping’s leadership,” said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should free Du Bin immediately and unconditionally and drop all charges.”</p><p>Du’s arrest appears to be related to his books, which the authorities allege “attack national leaders.” However, Du’s family have said that they have yet to receive notice of a formal criminal arrest or charge, in apparent violation of the notification requirements in China’s Criminal Procedure Law.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the third time that the authorities have detained Du, but the first time he has been formally charged (逮捕).</p><p>The authorities detained Du for a month in 2013 for releasing a documentary, “Above the Ghosts' Head: The Women of Masanjia Labour Camp,” and a book, “The Tiananmen Massacre.” He was detained for a month in 2020 for allegedly “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” because of his books critical of the Chinese government. Du’s books, all published abroad, include the “Changchun Hunger Siege,” a historical account published in 2017 about the deaths from starvation of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Changchun during the Chinese civil war.</p><p>Du previously worked as a journalist and photographer for various domestic and international outlets, including the New York Times, Beijing Youth Daily&nbsp;(北京青年报), and Workers’ Daily&nbsp;(工人日报).&nbsp;</p><p>Under Xi Jinping’s leadership for the past decade, the authorities have arrested and prosecuted a number of Chinese journalists in violation of their rights to freedom of expression and association. Reporters Without Border has reported that 121 journalists are currently detained in China.</p><p>In November, Beijing’s High Court upheld a seven-year sentence for Dong Yuyu, 62, a journalist arrested in February 2022 on espionage charges while he was having lunch with a Japanese diplomat. Dong had been writing for a Chinese government newspaper, Guangming Daily, for 35 years before his arrest.</p><p>In September, a court sentenced a citizen-journalist, Zhang Zhan, 42, to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking troubles.” Zhang had previously served four years in prison under the same article for her reporting on the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan.</p><p>After Zhang’s second conviction, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said the crime of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble … given its broad wording and the wide scope of its potential application to those exercising their rights, including freedom of expression and association,” is “at variance with China’s international human rights obligations.”</p><p>In June 2024, a court in Guangzhou sentenced a feminist activist and journalist, Huang Xueqin, 37, to five years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power” for her writing, including about the 2019 Hong Kong protests and her role in the #MeTooMovement.</p><p>In Hong Kong, Jimmy Lai, 78, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon and owner of the shuttered Apple Daily is facing up to life in prison on two fabricated “foreign collusion” charges under Hong Kong’s draconian National Security Law.</p><p>“Concerned governments should publicly raise Du Bin’s case with the Chinese government and press for his immediate and unconditional release,” Uluyol said. “By bringing baseless charges against its critics, Beijing is merely broadcasting to the world the fragility of its rule.”&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/12/china-veteran-journalist-charged-with-picking-quarrels,6,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-17T01:11:55.364432+00:00

<p>Following a&nbsp;gathering&nbsp;of Council of Europe states on International Human Rights Day,&nbsp;27 countries called for “migration reform”,&nbsp;attacking the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights for their role in upholding the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. This latest anti-migrant rhetoric comes at the same time as the EU’s wave of regressive and cruel measures.</p><p>Earlier this week, EU home affairs ministers agreed to the European Commission’s proposals to offshore migration responsibilities despite human rights concerns. The centerpiece of discussions was what is referred to in the new policy as the “Return Regulation,” which aims to increase deportations of rejected asylum seekers and migrants.</p><p>EU member states would be allowed to conclude agreements with third countries to establish “return hubs” outside EU territory where individuals scheduled for deportation could be sent. The Commission’s draft provides no clarity on applicable law or accountability, and EU governments want to eliminate even the existing minimal monitoring provisions. The agreement broadens detention grounds, greatly increasing the risk of prolonged or indefinite detention. Such measures have&nbsp;no demonstrated effect on return rates, nor are they cost-effective.</p><p>EU law enforcement authorities will now also demand onerous cooperation from third-country nationals subject to a deportation order. These obligations impose requirements that many individuals are unlikely to be able to meet for reasons like lack of identity documents or a fixed residence, risking entry bans and financial or even criminal sanctions. New “detection” measures raise concerns about surveillance and racial profiling, and would legitimize discriminatory policing that targets racialized communities.</p><p>Since the Commission’s proposal was adopted,&nbsp;civil society organizations have called on governments to reject these inhumane deportation rules and&nbsp;reconsider the alarming direction of ongoing negotiations.</p><p>Under other policies agreed this week, EU states could send asylum seekers to a third country deemed “safe” even in absence of any meaningful connection between the asylum seeker and that country. The officials also endorsed an EU list of “safe countries of origin” whose nationals will automatically be subject to fast-track asylum procedures, often at border or transit zones, where individuals at risk of persecution may be denied proper assessment.</p><p>Respect for human rights and the rule of law is enshrined in the binding EU founding treaties. Return rules that violate fundamental rights are not only unlawful but also come at a considerable cost to human beings and the EU’s stated values.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/12/european-states-double-down-on-cruel-immigration-policies,2,2.3043031,48.848139,2025-12-17T01:11:56.858560+00:00

<p>On December 9, CIVICUS Monitor, a nongovernmental group assessing civic freedoms globally,&nbsp;downgraded&nbsp;France’s civic space from “narrowed” to&nbsp;“obstructed.”</p><p>The downgrade is the result of years of attacks on civic space, marked by “escalating police violence, surveillance practices, and arrests of protesters, targeting of journalists, and persistent restrictions on fundamental rights,” according to CIVICUS. The French government is also increasingly using heavy-handed administrative measures to silence legitimate dissent, a trend I can confirm myself based on my work at Human Rights Watch, focusing on restrictions on civil society.</p><p>The&nbsp;2021&nbsp;“separatism law” gives the government broad powers to&nbsp;shut down nongovernmental groups by ministerial decree, and obliges organizations to sign a&nbsp;“Contract of Republican Engagement” with vague requirements (for example, “refrain from any action that undermines public order”) as a condition for public funds and other benefits from the state. The loose language of the “contract” gives the authorities a wide margin for interpretation, fostering arbitrary decisions to sanction civic organizations. Both tools have created a&nbsp;climate of pressure and&nbsp;self-censorship among civil society.</p><p>Another key factor that led to the downgrade is law enforcement’s abuse of peaceful protesters. For years,&nbsp;nongovernmental organizations,&nbsp;including Human Rights Watch, have&nbsp;documented police use of&nbsp;excessive force during protests, including the use of dangerous crowd control weapons. The United Nations Committee Against Torture, in its May 2025 concluding observations on France,&nbsp;expressed deep concern over numerous allegations of excessive use of force, including lethal force, and ill-treatment by law enforcement officers, noting that these abuses disproportionately affect minority groups. Groups working on Palestine solidarity have also&nbsp;faced restrictions, according to CIVICUS.</p><p>The French government should urgently take note of this downgrade, as well as&nbsp;serious concerns raised by rights bodies,and restore respect for civic space in line with its international and EU fundamental rights obligations, and under the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Commission, as the guardian of EU treaties, should use its annual&nbsp;Rule of Law report to issue strong recommendations to address the rule of law backsliding in France.</p><p>Human rights groups and other civil society organizations should be able to exercise the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly without fear of arbitrary retaliation.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/12/rule-of-law-backsliding-in-france,2,-99.8937059,33.1845447,2025-12-17T01:11:58.265708+00:00

<p>(Johannesburg) – Thousands of civilians displaced by Islamist armed group attacks in northeastern Mozambique have been sheltering in overcrowded and inadequate conditions, Human Rights Watch said today. Mozambique’s government should work with international agencies to provide sufficient support for people in need.</p><p>Between November 10 and 23, 2025, an armed group linked to the Islamic State-Mozambique, known as Al-Shabab or Mashababos,&nbsp;killed 12 civilians in Cabo Delgado and 21 in Nampula provinces, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data, a nongovernmental monitoring group. The International Organization for Migration&nbsp;reported that during this period, the attacks forced about 108,000 people, including about&nbsp;70,000 children, to flee their homes in Nampula’s Memba district for already&nbsp;overcrowded areas in Eráti and other coastal localities.</p><p>“Displaced people in northern Mozambique, including many children, are living in extremely precarious conditions without adequate food, health care, shelter, and mental health support,” said Sheila Nhancale, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Mozambican authorities need to take immediate measures to meet their needs and protect them from further risks.”</p><p>Local media&nbsp;reported children being separated from their families due to the displacement; older people being abandoned; and&nbsp;dozens sleeping outdoors, exposed to rain and cold and without shelter or adequate food, including women who are&nbsp;pregnant and nursing. Many are living in schools, administrative buildings, and other spaces not designed to shelter people. Hygiene and sanitation conditions at these sites have&nbsp;deteriorated with outbreaks of diarrheal diseases and malaria.</p><p>“We are living under trees, without a safe place to stay,” said a displaced woman in Alua Sede, Eráti district, who has not heard from her husband in more than two weeks since she escaped with her children from Mazua, Memba district. “We urgently ask for help because the situation is becoming unbearable.”</p><p>“Some of the displaced are housed in crowded tents,” said a displaced man at a shelter in Alua Sede. “There are not enough tents, and children are mixed with everyone else. Food is insufficient.”</p><p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had previously&nbsp;reported that as of late October, about 90,000 people, including 52,000 children, had been displaced by attacks beginning in September across both provinces. The children had limited access to health care, education, and safe shelter. Girls have been exposed to gender-based violence.</p><p>While the Mozambican government has taken steps to respond to the crisis, including mobilizing resources and coordinating with humanitarian partners, its capacity has been&nbsp;overstretched because of the number of people displaced, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The state’s legal responsibility in these situations is to ensure security and guarantee minimum conditions for survival,” said Isidro Júlio, chairperson of the Provincial Council of the Mozambique Bar Association in Nampula. “This implies arranging a place for these people to live and ensuring access to food, water, and other basic needs.”</p><p>On December 3, Nampula’s governor, Eduardo Abdula,&nbsp;met with civil society organizations, businesspeople, and local authorities to discuss urgent solutions to the humanitarian crisis. The government and humanitarian partners, including UN agencies and international nongovernmental organizations, have begun delivering food and safe water and providing emergency shelter, sanitation and hygiene facilities, some healthcare services, and protection assistance. However, resources remain&nbsp;overstretched as newly displaced people arrive daily.</p><p>OCHA&nbsp;reported that during a three-week period in November, the Nampula provincial government mobilized 100 tons of food, which could only support about 13,500 people for 15 days. The National Institute for Disaster Management also distributed food kits to 8,000 people. During the same period, humanitarian agencies provided assistance to 8,500 people, delivering a package of food, shelter, non-food items, and water and sanitation support. However, the supplies don’t meet the scale of the need.</p><p>Mozambique’s constitution guarantees the rights to life, security, and adequate living conditions, which reinforce regional and international conventions protecting internally displaced people.</p><p>Mozambique is party to the&nbsp;African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), which provides that governments “shall provide sufficient protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, and where available resources are inadequate to enable them to do so, they shall cooperate in seeking the assistance of international organizations and humanitarian agencies, civil society organizations and other relevant actors.”</p><p>Since October 2017, Al-Shabab has&nbsp;attacked numerous villages, killed&nbsp;more than 2,500 people, and&nbsp;destroyed extensive civilian property and infrastructure including schools and health centers in Cabo Delgado. The conflict began in Cabo Delgado and has since spread to neighboring provinces, including some districts in Nampula province, displacing over&nbsp;1.3 million people, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2025, armed groups began striking multiple areas&nbsp;simultaneously, putting some longstanding host communities at risk.</p><p>“The Mozambican government, with additional support from donor countries and humanitarian agencies, should urgently meet the protection and assistance needs of all those displaced, in line with its international obligations,” Nhancale said. “The government should also investigate and appropriately prosecute those responsible for abuses in the current fighting.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/11/mozambique-thousands-displaced-in-poor-conditions,4,-98.5795,39.8283,2025-12-17T01:11:58.266355+00:00

<p>The International Automobile Federation (Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile, or FIA), the international body governing motor sports, including Formula1, held its annual&nbsp;General Assemblies last week in Tashkent,&nbsp;Uzbekistan.&nbsp;</p><p>At the General Assemblies, the federation&nbsp;presented Uzbekistan as the “star of the east,” seemingly without a single reference to Uzbekistan’s deeply problematic human rights record. In recent years, Uzbek authorities have increasingly&nbsp;stifled human rights activism and freedom of expression, targeting activists, bloggers, and others with unfounded criminal and administrative charges. Despite United Nations experts calling for&nbsp;his immediate release,&nbsp;Karakalpak activist and lawyer Dauletmurat Tazhimuratov is languishing in prison, serving a wrongful 16-year prison sentence, his allegations of ill-treatment and torture ignored by authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>The FIA’s&nbsp;statutes instruct it to “promote the protection of human rights and human dignity,” while its&nbsp;Code of Ethics affirms its “responsibility to safeguard the integrity and reputation of motor sport.” Promoting and conducting business with a country without conducting a human rights impact assessment is risky. Doing so may breach the FIA’s regulations and leave a lasting stain on motor sports.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set out how businesses should implement policies and conduct due diligence in regards to their impact on human rights. Such due diligence should include the risk of laundering the reputations of governments, businesses, or individuals responsible for ongoing or recent serious rights abuses.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has previously raised rights concerns in connection with FIA and Formula 1 activities in&nbsp;Azerbaijan and&nbsp;Saudi Arabia, where abusive governments have used motor sports to whitewash their reputations.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the assemblies in Tashkent, Human Rights Watch&nbsp;asked the FIA and&nbsp;Formula 1, who adopted a&nbsp;commitment to respect human rights, their plans to discuss rights issues during the assemblies and the type of due diligence they conduct. We received no response.</p><p>FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem, recently&nbsp;re-elected for a second term, should seize this opportunity to take much stronger human rights actions in Uzbekistan and globally. The federation should use its influence with governments to urge rights reforms and roll out comprehensive due diligence to identify and remedy any adverse rights impact of its activities and ensure that&nbsp;motor sports continue to “drive society forward.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/19/in-uzbekistan-motor-sports-body-misses-the-mark-on-rights,2,78.6677428,22.3511148,2026-01-02T23:45:43.901705+00:00

<p>A new executive order seeking to designate&nbsp;“illicit fentanyl” a “weapon of mass destruction” could open the door to a dangerous expansion of militarized law enforcement and abusive military action.</p><p>The December 15&nbsp;order directs the defense secretary and attorney general to&nbsp;“determine whether the threats posed by fentanyl and its impact on the United States” justifies the  Defense Department aiding the Justice Department in law enforcement.</p><p>The order states that fentanyl has the potential&nbsp;“to be weaponized for concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.” But&nbsp;domestic and&nbsp;international law already authorize responsive action if fentanyl were employed as a chemical weapon.&nbsp;</p><p>This order is particularly worrying amid the Trump administration’s use of drug trafficking as a pretext to justify unlawful military strikes. Since September, the administration has carried out more than two dozen strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, resulting in&nbsp;at least 99&nbsp;extrajudicial killings. This context raises the concern that the order aims to facilitate an expansion of such unlawful actions.</p><p>The executive order is also dangerous in the current domestic context, following months of National Guard deployments to multiple&nbsp;US cities. While US law enforcement agencies commit many&nbsp;human rights abuses, the involvement of the military in law enforcement would pose&nbsp;additional risks. Military forces bring fundamentally different training and experience to bear, focused less on rights-respecting law enforcement and more on the effective use of lethal force.</p><p>While governments have a legitimate interest in working to stop drug trafficking, addressing the harm of unregulated fentanyl requires an emphasis on&nbsp;evidence-based public health&nbsp;interventions. Militarized policing in US communities could unleash serious abuses, especially against Black and other&nbsp;overpoliced communities. US drug policy has historically fueled&nbsp;racially discriminatory policing, arrests, and incarceration. It has not adequately addressed harm caused by drug trafficking, like overdose deaths, which disproportionately affect Black and Indigenous people, who face&nbsp;disparities in health care access.</p><p>The administration should channel concern about fentanyl into&nbsp;harm reduction strategies that safeguard rights, rather than calling it a weapon of mass destruction to create the illusion of a threat that warrants military action.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/19/trump-labels-fentanyl-weapon-of-mass-destruction,6,-76.602191,39.6823264,2026-01-02T23:45:45.229078+00:00

<p>Kazakhstan’s Senate adopted two rights-violating laws on December 18, both of them threatening freedom of expression.&nbsp;</p><p>The first is a discriminatory&nbsp;draft law banning so-called propaganda of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) expression, which would make it illegal to publicly support LGBT rights. The clear intention of the bill is to silence all forms of pro-LGBT expression. If the law enters into force, public forms of pro-LGBT expression in Kazakhstan will carry administrative sanctions.</p><p>The second is a&nbsp;draft law on crime prevention, which introduces the notion of “antisocial behavior,” or behavior that contravenes “generally accepted standards of behavior and morality.”&nbsp;</p><p>The bill does not define what “generally accepted standards” are but nevertheless provides for “involving citizens in crime prevention” by registering volunteers as “public assistants,” who maybe tasked with “ensuring the maintenance of public order in public places.” The volunteers may be granted monetary reward or a certificate in recognition of their assistance. They are also authorized to use physical force to prevent law violations and apprehend offenders.</p><p>Without a clear definition in Kazakh law for “generally accepted standards of behavior and morality,” there is significant risk the law would be arbitrarily applied to suppress legitimate forms of expression. Some&nbsp;countries, for example, have deemed that women laughing in public or too loud constitutes immoral or antisocial behavior. Several have categorized public support of LGBT rights or&nbsp;being in a same-sex relationship in similar ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Governments have duties to protect everyone’s fundamental rights as defined by international human rights law, including people from marginalized groups. This also includes the right to criticize government policies or form organizations that defend the rights of all people.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has spoken of “building a Just Kazakhstan,” a country, he’s proclaimed, “of equal opportunities and progress.” These draft laws are the opposite of that vision, taking Kazakhstan backwards to a time when&nbsp;citizens were encouraged to inform on each other to the police.</p><p>These two rights-violating laws will soon land on President Tokayev’s desk for his signature. When they do, he should do the right thing for Kazakhstan and veto them.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/18/kazakhstan-draft-morality-laws-threaten-rights,2,66.7780818,48.1012954,2026-01-02T23:45:46.605097+00:00

<p>Discussions are advancing at the United Nations on a new global treaty to guarantee every child’s right to a free education. Last week, countries gathered at the UN in Geneva to explore ways of strengthening international law around access to free pre-primary and secondary education. At least 74 countries from all regions participated, reflecting broad and sustained interest in an initiative led by Sierra Leone and the Dominican Republic.</p><p>It is low- and lower-middle-income countries that are taking the lead on the initiative, having already demonstrated their commitment to children’s education by introducing national reforms. In particular, Sierra Leone has enshrined 13 years of free schooling from pre-primary through secondary education in law. Malawi, the newest member of the group of leading states, will introduce free secondary education in 2026.</p><p>New treaty provisions are being discussed because, as Sierra Leone’s education minister recently highlighted, while existing international law guarantees children free primary education, the Convention on the Rights of the Child says nothing explicit about early childhood or pre-primary education, nor does it require states to guarantee every child free secondary education. A UNESCO report released last week also highlighted these gaps.</p><p>An obvious solution to fill these gaps would be to update the Convention on the Rights of the Child through a new optional protocol. This approach would create legally binding obligations, push governments to reform laws and policies, and ensure real oversight and accountability. Such a protocol would mean millions of children—especially those from low-income families, girls, and children with disabilities—could dramatically improve their opportunities and life outcomes.</p><p>Support for the initiative is growing and at the meeting, two more countries announced their support, bringing those publicly backing the process to 60, while many other countries, particularly African, European, and Latin American countries, reaffirmed their commitment to moving the initiative forward. However, there is still resistance, with the United Kingdom and Belgium maintaining their opposition, this time joined by Russia.</p><p>More than 400 million children are out of school from pre-primary through secondary often simply because their families cannot afford it. The time is now to take bold action and move forward with updating the Convention on the Rights of the Child, so that every child, everywhere, can claim the education to which they are entitled.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/18/growing-support-for-treaty-to-guarantee-free-education-for-every-child,2,105.3188,61.524,2026-01-02T23:45:46.605364+00:00

<p>(Washington, DC, December 18, 2025) –&nbsp;United States federal immigration enforcement agents now commonly operate masked and without visible identification, compounding the abusive and unaccountable nature of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, Human Rights Watch said today. The indefinite and widespread nature of these practices is fundamentally inconsistent with the United States’ obligations to ensure that law enforcement abuses are investigated and met with accountability.</p><p>“Law enforcement officers must be identifiable to be accountable,” said&nbsp;Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “This kind of secrecy should be an exception, never the norm, and it’s even more alarming given the widespread abuses associated with immigration arrests in recent months.”</p><p>Since President Donald Trump’s return to office in January 2025, his administration has carried out an&nbsp;abusive&nbsp;campaign of immigration raids and arrests, primarily of people of color, across the country. Many of the raids target places where Latino people work, shop, eat, and live. The agents have&nbsp;seized people in courthouses and at&nbsp;regularly-scheduled&nbsp;appointments with immigration officials, as well as in places of worship,&nbsp;schools, and other sensitive locations. Many raids have been marked by the sudden and&nbsp;unprovoked use of force without any justification, creating a climate of&nbsp;fear in many immigrant communities.</p><p>These immigration enforcement operations have often involved Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and, in some cases, civilian clothes. Agents are regularly concealing agency insignias and using unmarked vehicles to detain people who are in their cars and at courthouses, schools, workplaces, homes, on the street, and in public transport.&nbsp;</p><p>On its website, ICE&nbsp;justifies the widespread practice of masking “to prevent doxing.” This kind of generalized, blanket justification for concealing officers’ identity is not compatible with US human rights obligations, except when necessary and proportionate to address particular safety concerns, Human Rights Watch said. When applied as a broad, default approach, such measures serve as a barrier to accountability inconsistent with US human rights obligations. Anonymity also weakens deterrence, fosters conditions for impunity, and chills the exercise of rights.</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people who witnessed arrests by or who were arrested by unidentifiable people in five US cities since January 20. They all described the incidents as frightening, with a sense that they couldn’t do anything if they were abused, especially with the agents unidentifiable. Human Rights Watch also reviewed dozens of videos of&nbsp;stops and&nbsp;arrests involving&nbsp;masked agents&nbsp;posted on&nbsp;social&nbsp;media.</p><p>In one example, on March 25 at about 5:15 p.m., at least six officers, all in civilian dress and unmarked vehicles, without identifying themselves, confronted and stopped Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, 30, who was apparently targeted for writing an&nbsp;opinion piece in a student newspaper calling on Tufts to “acknowledge the&nbsp;Palestinian genocide” and divest from&nbsp;investments connected to Israel. Öztürk, who had been living in the United States for six years, told Human Rights Watch about the incident, which was also captured on CCTV&nbsp;footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Öztürk was walking on the street when several masked people approached her, forcibly took her phone and backpack, and placed her in handcuffs. Öztürk said when she asked who they were and to see their badges, one said they were “police” and one flashed a gold necklace, but she did not see a badge attached, and it did not help her identify them. In the footage, a bystander is heard asking the agents: “Why are you hiding your faces?” Öztürk said she was not shown any paperwork justifying her arrest. She was then forcibly removed from the state and wrongfully&nbsp;detained.</p><p>“It was a horrible feeling,” Öztürk said. “I didn’t think that they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this. I thought they were people who were doxing me, and I was genuinely very afraid for my safety… As a woman who’s traveled and lived alone in various countries for my studies, I’ve never experienced intense fear for my safety—until that moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>One woman who has witnessed numerous raids and stops in Chicago since August said: “I’ve had experiences with agents who refused to identify themselves. That adds another level of fear. These are not identifiable police officers who could be held publicly accountable.” A man from Washington, DC, who has also witnessed numerous arrests by masked ICE agents since August, said these tactics have “completely destroyed any trust we’ve had for local and federal law enforcement.”</p><p>Many observers have suggested that the terror these tactics instill is by design. One US District Court judge asserted in a&nbsp;ruling&nbsp;that “ICE goes masked for a single reason—to terrorize Americans into quiescence… We have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The court dismissed ICE’s stated rationale for masking as “disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable.”</p><p>In recent months, media outlets have reported on people posing as federal agents&nbsp;kidnapping,&nbsp;sexually assaulting, and&nbsp;extorting victims, exploiting fears of immigration enforcement. This demonstrates how the lines can be blurred between criminals and law enforcement officers when federal agents themselves are unidentifiable, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Several&nbsp;states are taking steps to pass&nbsp;legislation to restrict law enforcement officers from&nbsp;concealing their&nbsp;identities during public interactions. It is unlikely these initiatives would be enforceable. At the federal level, the proposed&nbsp;VISIBLE Act, backed by Senators Cory Booker and Alex Padilla, would mandate legible identification and prohibit nonmedical face coverings for immigration enforcement officers.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress should investigate the brutality of the ongoing immigration enforcement activities, including the specific impacts of unidentifiable agents carrying out stops and arrests on impeding investigations and accountability efforts, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Allowing masked, unidentified agents to roam communities and apprehend people without identifying themselves erodes trusts in the rule of law and creates a dangerous vacuum where abuses can flourish, exacerbating the unnecessary violence and brutality of the arrests,” Wille said.</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/18/us-masked-federal-agents-undermine-rule-of-law,0,34.8516,31.0461,2026-01-02T23:45:46.606084+00:00

<p>(London, December 17, 2025) – Authorities in Kazakhstan have targeted independent journalists and media outlets in recent weeks, a coalition of nine human rights groups said today. The authorities have searched the newsroom of an independent news agency, detained media workers, and pressured journalists over their reporting.</p><p>The coalition includes Amnesty International, Civil Rights Defenders, Crude Accountability, Freedom for Eurasia, Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, International Partnership for Human Rights, and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee.</p><p>“Astana should end the crackdown on free expression and independent journalism, which are essential to protecting human rights and civil liberties,” said Maisy Weicherding, Central Asia researcher at Amnesty International. “Kazakhstan should respect and uphold the right to media freedom and access to information.”</p><p>On December 1, 2025, police searched the independent Orda.kz media agency’s newsroom and detained media workers, at least one of whom is facing criminal charges. Other independent journalists have been under pressure from government officials and their social media accounts have been taken down. On December 2, the website of an independent media outlet experienced a distributed denial of service attack, to make a website unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.</p><p>The Kazakhstan government has repeatedly pledged to uphold the right to freedom of expression, consistent with its Constitution and international obligations, including in January at its&nbsp;fourth Universal Periodic Review at the UN.</p><p>On December 1, police in Almaty&nbsp;detained Gulnara Bazhkenova, editor-in-chief of the independent news outlet Orda.kz, as a person of interest in several criminal cases, including for allegedly spreading “repeated and deliberate” false information. On the same day, a court ordered her held for&nbsp;two months of house arrest, her lawyer said.</p><p>Bazhkenova was arrested following a&nbsp;police search of the Almaty newsroom of Orda.kz and Bazhkenova’s home. The outlet’s legal representatives and staff said that investigative teams seized documents, equipment, and money for staff salaries. They forced open a safe. Officials physically searched Bazhkenova and an accountant. The authorities at the office denied Orda.kz’s lawyers permission to enter even though the lawyers had proper authorization, and barred them from reviewing the search warrant, both criminal procedural code violations.</p><p>On the same day in Astana, police questioned Dmitry Kim, head of Orda.kz’s capital bureau, for several hours at the outlet’s office and later took him to a police station. He was released the same day.</p><p>On November 28, independent journalists Lukpan Akhmedyarov and Raul Uporov published a&nbsp;documentary film, “The Duty of the Motherland,” on their&nbsp;YouTube channel&nbsp;“Prosto Journalistika” (JustJournalism_kz), highlighting the deaths of 270 Kazakhstani soldiers over the past three years. Most were conscripts who apparently died following illnesses, weapons-related incidents, or suicides.</p><p>The film followed a protest on November 10 in Astana, where mothers of deceased and injured soldiers gathered outside the House of Ministries demanding accountability and justice for soldiers’ deaths and injuries.</p><p>Akhmedyarov told the rights groups and&nbsp;reported in the media that several days before the film’s release, he received a phone call from a contact in the Defense Ministry relaying a request from “a high-ranking official” to avoid “stirring up the issue with the army.” After Akhmedyarov published a Facebook post about the threat, his&nbsp;Facebook account became inaccessible for three days.</p><p>A separate Instagram account he ran for his “Just Journalism” project&nbsp;was temporarily removed in July. He said it was a targeted attack.</p><p>The Facebook incident appears to be the latest of a recent string of interference in online expression in Kazakhstan. In late November, the Instagram accounts of&nbsp;three other independent voices in Kazakhstan became inaccessible or were temporarily removed.</p><p>Vadim Boreyko, an independent journalist based in Almaty,&nbsp;reported on November 22 that he found his Instagram account emptied of content. He described the incident as the latest in multiple instances of harassment that includes repeated removals of older posts on Instagram and Facebook for vague “violations.” Since then, the content on his account appears to have been restored.</p><p>An Almaty-based activist, Askhat Niyazov, received notification on his Instagram that his account had been removed for “community guidelines violations.” On November 28, another Almaty-based activist, Sanjar Bokayev, received notification on Instagram that his account had been removed for “community guidelines violations.” Their accounts have since been restored. On November 30, Bokayev’s account on Facebook was blocked “for security reasons.” It too has been restored.</p><p>On December 12, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, asking about the temporary blocking and removal of accounts and if these actions had been taken in response to Kazakhstan government requests. Meta responded saying that they “strive to notify users and share information externally” about taking action on content that violates local law, but were unable to respond substantively to the specific questions posed by the time of publication.</p><p>The editorial team of the independent outlet Vlast.kz&nbsp;reported on December 2 that its website had experienced intensive DDoS attacks over several days, especially on December 2. They said the attacks caused significant interruptions to the website’s operations.</p><p>Kazakhstan’s parliament has also&nbsp;advanced legislation severely restricting the rights and visibility of LGBTI individuals, including broad and vaguely defined prohibitions on public expression relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. These provisions pose a direct threat not only to people identifying as LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex), but also to journalists, academics, artists, human rights defenders, and civil society actors who risk administrative sanctions for reporting on or advocating for the rights of these groups, or for expressing positive views of LGBTI rights publicly or online.</p><p>Such measures constitute discrimination and violate Kazakhstan’s Constitution, including guarantees of equality before the law and freedom of expression, as well as the country’s binding obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>They also contradict Kazakhstan’s commitments within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe framework to uphold pluralism, tolerance, and non-discrimination, as well as international standards articulated by UN experts. The experts have repeatedly emphasized that states may not restrict expression relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to suppress public debate or silence marginalized groups.</p><p>“The advancement of so-called propaganda legislation is not only blatantly homophobic and discriminatory, but it also marks a dangerous expansion of state control over public discourse and further erodes the already shrinking civic space in the country,” said Leila Seiitbek, director of Freedom for Eurasia. “On December 18, when the bill goes to a vote in Kazakhstan’s Senate, lawmakers should decisively vote against this harmful piece of legislation.”</p><p>The Kazakhstan government, in particular the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor General’s Office, should cease harassment, intimidation, and pressure against journalists and media outlets, the groups said. It should protect the public’s right to access to information, and cease spurious criminal investigations into independent journalists, including against Bazhkenova.</p><p>The authorities should also withdraw the discriminatory “propaganda” bill. Kazakhstan should guarantee the right to freedom of expression for all and ensure that government policies promote tolerance and nondiscrimination.</p><p>Social media platforms should respect the human rights of users in Kazakhstan and resist any content or account takedown requests that unlawfully restrict expression protected under international human rights law, the groups also said.</p><p>“Unfounded restrictions on journalists and freedom of expression are long-standing rights issues in Kazakhstan,” said Mihra Rittmann, Central Asia adviser at Human Rights Watch. “The government needs to stop all attacks on independent journalists and media outlets and create an enabling environment for freedom of expression.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/17/kazakhstan-journalism-free-expression-in-further-peril,4,66.7780818,48.1012954,2026-01-02T23:45:47.941230+00:00

<p>(Beirut) –&nbsp;Egyptian authorities should quash the conviction of prominent economist Abd al-Khaliq Farouk, who on October 2, 2025, was sentenced to five years in prison for articles and social media posts in violation of his free speech and due process rights, Human Rights Watch said today. An appeals court is scheduled to hear his case on December 25.</p><p>A misdemeanor court convicted Farouk of “disseminating false news” under the penal code for criticizing Egypt’s economic policy and alleging government corruption. Egyptian authorities have violated Farouk’s right to freedom of expression as well as his due process rights, including his right to a fair trial. He is currently being held under conditions that raise concerns for his health and he said he is being ill-treated.</p><p>“Prosecuting a prominent economist solely for his speech and analysis reflects the dangerous level of repression in Egypt today, casting economic research and intellectual debate as criminal acts,” said&nbsp;Amr Magdi, senior Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities should immediately release Dr. Farouk, whose long imprisonment is just the latest case in which Egypt’s government makes a mockery of free speech guarantees and due process rights.”</p><p>Security forces raided Farouk’s home in Cairo on October 20, 2024, arrested him, and confiscated his phone, laptop, and unpublished draft writings, his wife, Nagla Salama, told Human Rights Watch. They also confiscated her laptop and phone and have not returned them.</p><p>Two days before his arrest, Farouk published a Facebook&nbsp;post, “The Theft of the Century,” compiling 40 of his articles about economic subjects including the military’s&nbsp;encroachment into the civilian economy and its opaque business dealings. Human Rights Watch reviewed a selection of Farouk’s posts and found that they criticize President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, other officials, and the Egyptian military.&nbsp;</p><p>While the authorities have previously detained Farouk several times for his writings, his wife said his current detention conditions at the 10th of Ramadan prison complex are “by far the worst.” She said he is kept in near-total isolation, locked in his cell for 23 hours a day with two other prisoners. He is allowed one hour outside his cell, but in an enclosed space without sunlight and is denied meaningful contact with others.</p><p>Following Farouk’s arrest, the Supreme State Security Prosecution interrogated him about his writings stretching back several years,&nbsp;his wife and lawyer said. The authorities charged him under article 80(d) and article 102 bis of the penal code concerning “disseminating false statements,” his lawyer, Nabih el-Genady said. Both articles have been used to criminalize peaceful speech, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Since his arrest, the authorities have held Farouk in pretrial detention without bail. Human Rights Watch has documented that Egyptian authorities since 2013 have imposed unjustified, prolonged pretrial detention to punish critics and stifle dissent. The authorities have conducted Farouq’s pretrial detention renewal hearings remotely through a video system without bringing him physically before a judge. The remote hearings system widely used in recent years&nbsp;exacerbates abusive pretrial detention in violation of international law.</p><p>The Shorouk Misdemeanor Court, a first instance court for minor offenses, did not formally notify Farouk’s lawyers of his initial court hearing on September 25 and denied them access to the approximately 500-page case file, his lawyer said. The court issued the five-year sentence at the second hearing without allowing for a meaningful defense. His wife said that Farouq only learned of the verdict on October 7, when she was visiting him.&nbsp;</p><p>The appeal has already raised due process concerns. His lawyers said that the appeals court allowed them to only briefly read the case file in court but did not permit them to make a copy for review.</p><p>The Egyptian authorities should immediately release Farouk and all other prisoners held for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, including&nbsp;Ismail Iskandarani, a researcher, and&nbsp;Ashraf Omar, a cartoonist, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, both of which Egypt has ratified, guarantee everyone the right to freedom of expression, to a fair and public hearing, and to adequate time and resources to prepare a defense.</p><p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee, which authoritatively interprets the covenant,&nbsp;requires any limitations on free expression to be proportionate, stated in a precise manner, in a way to enable people to reasonably predict what constitutes a violation, and necessary to protect national security, public order, public health, or morals in a democratic society.&nbsp;</p><p>The committee has also&nbsp;stated that the right to a fair trial, including appeals, requires “access to documents and other evidence” including “all materials that the prosecution plans to offer in court against the accused or that are exculpatory.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The prosecution of Dr. Farouk is just the latest case in which Egyptian authorities have sought to secure a brutally harsh sentence as punishment for those who criticize Sisi’s government and its policies,” Magdi said. “Such abuses not only strangle the space for freedom of expression in the country but deprive Egyptian society of the ability to contest the government’s economic policies amid widespread poverty and economic crises.”</p>",https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/17/egypt-quash-conviction-of-prominent-economist,0,29.2675469,26.2540493,2026-01-02T23:45:49.284813+00:00
