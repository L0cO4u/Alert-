They revealed last week that anonymous individuals were distributing in the United Kingdom and Australia sexually explicit deepfakes depicting them and their families. While police investigations in both countries could not trace the origins of these images, after Lau went public, a Chinese government spokesperson defended the pursuit of “wanted fugitives” as “legitimate and reasonable.”</p><p>There is evidence that the Chinese government was directly involved in a similar case in 2024, when anonymous online accounts circulated threatening and sexually suggestive posts targeting the 16-year-old daughter of Deng Yuwen, a US-based critic of the Chinese government, that were subsequently traced back to China’s security agencies. These tactics appear to have surged in recent years: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank, noted the increasingly gendered nature of online harassment against critics of the Chinese government as early as 2022.</p><p>While not all online harassment can be traced to Beijing, the government’s actions against exiled critics—issuing baseless arrest warrants and bounties and publishing violent rhetoric in government outlets (such as calling activists the “black hands” that “need to be cut off”)—signal to the Chinese diaspora worldwide that these activists are enemies of the state. Such encouragement effectively paints a target on their backs for harassment, surveillance, and abuse.</p><p>Governments need to take effective steps against “transnational repression”—cross-border abuses against activists and their families. First, they should publicly condemn such acts, especially harassment designed to psychologically abuse, shame, and marginalize critics.</p><p>Second, they need to investigate cases thoroughly, track patterns of transnational repression, and establish reporting mechanisms for diaspora communities. The US and Australian governments have taken some of these actions; other governments should follow suit.</p><p>Third, governments should commit to transparency by regularly reporting on progress addressing transnational repression.</p><p>Finally, governments need to commit to prioritizing victims. Beyond a law enforcement response, authorities should provide resources to support victims’ digital security and mental health needs, so that those exiled may enjoy the same rights as everyone else in their new country and feel safe again.</p>",

Witnesses from the village of Nkana, about 75 kilometers northeast of Kinshasa, the national capital, said that militiamen with firearms and machetes carried out an apparent retaliatory attack linked to rising intercommunal tensions.</p><p>On November 23, at about 4 a.m., Mobondo fighters from the ethnic Yaka community attacked Nkana, witnesses said. The assailants moved house to house, killing mostly ethnic Teke villagers in their homes and as they attempted to flee. Villagers said the fighters had accused Nkana’s Teke of refusing to install a new Yaka customary chief and sent messages to some Teke before the attack saying they would be punished.</p><p>“The violence in Kwamouth is just one of many deadly ethnic conflicts in Congo,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The global focus on the peace accords in eastern Congo shouldn’t distract from the unchecked violence and injustice and the cycles of impunity in other areas.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people in November and December, including 5 witnesses, 6 relatives of victims, local medical personnel, and community leaders from Kwamouth territory in Mai-Ndombe province.</p><p>Starting in June 2023, the Mobondo militia, named for their mystical amulets and armed with machetes, knives, spears, bows and arrows, and hunting and military assault rifles, have attacked Teke villages, burned houses, and killed dozens of people.</p><p>For years, civil society activists, human rights groups, and traditional authorities have warned about the escalating presence and activities of ethnic militias. The recent violence echoes the intercommunal crisis Human Rights Watch documented between 2022 and 2023, when militias from the Teke and Yaka communities killed hundreds of civilians in waves of attacks in the region.<br /><br />The recent attack underscores the Congolese government’s failure to scale-up security in the area despite repeated warnings of violence, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“When they broke down my door, I ran with my grandson,” said a 70-year-old woman about the recent violence. “They shot at me several times. One bullet hit my foot, but I kept running. If I had stayed for one more second, they would have killed us.”</p><p>Another villager said that fighters shot at his family as they attempted to escape: “My mother was carrying my daughter on her back. The first bullet struck her [his mother] in the heart. The second pierced her ribs and hit my daughter in the stomach.” His mother died instantly and his 5-year-old daughter died in the hospital on December 5.</p><p>Human Rights Watch documented the deaths of 22 civilians, including 4 women and 4 children. Among those killed were two sons of the village’s customary chief, the local Red Cross president, and a provincial tax authority official. A Congolese army soldier, who was guarding the village along with a small marine contingent that fled across the Congo River when the attack began, was also killed. Villagers said relatives buried their family members after the attackers left the area. Others were buried by soldiers when they arrived in the village.</p>\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n          \n                  \n\n\n                  \n          Click to expand Image\n          \n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n\n        \n                      \n      \n        \n                    © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n          \n    \n\n\n  \n<p>Medical staff in Maluku commune, in eastern Kinshasa, said that several patients arrived in critical condition, while other wounded civilians fled across the river to Congo-Brazzaville to seek treatment.</p><p>The attack forced hundreds of residents to flee toward Maluku or to cross into Congo-Brazzaville. Witnesses said that families tried to evacuate older people, the injured, and small children. The army has since tried to encourage villagers to return to Nkana, but many have refused and have thus lost access to their homes and fields, deepening an already precarious humanitarian situation.</p><p>Following the attack, Congolese authorities deployed military personnel to the area and announced an investigation into the killings. Residents said that a delegation of Teke community members traveled to Kinshasa carrying the bodies of victims to protest what they described as the government’s silence and inaction. Some lawmakers have called on the provincial assembly to adopt urgent measures to address the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Historically, Teke people have owned much of the land and customary titles in Kwamouth territory, a part of the Bateke Plateau (literally translated “the plateau of Teke people,”) which extends to the outskirts of Kinshasa. Over the years, members of the Yaka, Mbala, Suku, and other communities from neighboring Kwilu and Kwango provinces have formed the agricultural workforce for landowners in Kwamouth territory or have become farmers in return for a customary tax—which Teke farmers also pay—to Teke customary chiefs.</p><p>Mobondo militias have increased attacks since mid-2025, targeting villages along the Congo River, including Mbanzale and Mayala in June, an attack along national road 17 in August, and a September 2 attack in the Limpwobo forest zone. Despite periodic military deployments, no permanent government security presence has been established, leaving rural communities exposed to renewed attacks.</p><p>Congolese authorities should ensure a thorough and impartial investigation of those responsible for the militia attacks, Human Rights Watch said. They should also ensure that affected villagers receive medical and mental health support and that displaced people have access to shelter, food, and basic services.</p><p>The government should put into effect, with meaningful community participation, a demobilization program for Mobondo fighters announced on December 2 and convene an intercommunal peace forum for Mai-Ndombe province that was announced in September.</p><p>“Addressing the communal violence in western Congo requires justice and accountability, effective early warning systems, and a real commitment to breaking the structures that allow armed groups to flourish,” Mudge said. “Concerned governments and United Nations agencies should assist the Congolese authorities in making this happen.”</p>",

The government should quash the baseless conviction and immediately release Lai.</p><p>On December 15, 2025, the High Court found Lai, 78, guilty of two counts of “conspiracy to commit collusion with foreign forces” under the draconian National Security Law, and one count of “conspiracy to publish seditious publications” under the Crimes Ordinance. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison.</p><p>“The conviction of Jimmy Lai on bogus charges after five years of solitary confinement is both cruel and a travesty of justice,” said&nbsp;Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Chinese government’s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticize the Communist Party.”</p><p>The court ruled that Lai was the “mastermind” of the alleged conspiracies in all three counts. It said that Lai had conspired with others to commit “foreign collusion” by engaging in “international lobbying” and urging foreign governments to impose “sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities” against the&nbsp;Chinese government through his writings, talk shows, and media interviews.</p><p>The court also ruled that Lai had conspired with the advocacy group Stand with Hong Kong, which organized overseas campaigns calling for sanctions against the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.</p><p>For the sedition charge, prosecutors claimed that 161 Apple Daily articles, including 33 by Lai, constituted seditious publications because they allegedly fueled public distrust and hatred toward the authorities. The court agreed with the prosecution, ruling that Lai used his “personal influence to carry out a consistent campaign with a view to undermine the legitimacy” of the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.</p><p>Prosecuting someone for exercising their right to freedom of expression violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is incorporated into Hong Kong’s legal framework via the city’s de facto constitution, the Basic Law, and expressed in the Bill of Rights Ordinance. Hong Kong’s&nbsp;national security legal regime is incompatible with these human rights guarantees.</p><p>Six former Apple Daily executives and editors had previously pleaded guilty to similar charges in the same case. A hearing to consider mitigating circumstances is scheduled for January 12, 2026, with sentencing to follow. Under article 29 of the National Security Law, those convicted of “foreign collusion” of a “grave nature” face 10 years to life in prison, while others face 3 to 10 years. The “sedition” charge under the Crimes Ordinance carries a maximum of 2 years in prison.</p><p>Lai’s prosecution was marred by multiple serious&nbsp;violations of fair trial rights, including being tried by judges hand-picked by the Hong Kong government, denied a jury trial, subjected to prolonged pretrial detention, and barred from having counsel of his choice. In 2023, the High Court upheld the government’s decision to bar a British lawyer, Timothy Owen, from representing Lai. Authorities also&nbsp;denied Lai, a British citizen, consular access from the United Kingdom, in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which China is party.</p><p>Lai is already serving a 5-year and 9-month prison sentence on charges of “fraud” and “participating in an unauthorized assembly.” He suffers from diabetes and has been held in prolonged solitary confinement, a form of torture, since December 2020. His family has repeatedly raised&nbsp;concerns about his&nbsp;deteriorating health, including heart problems and signs of physical decline.</p><p>Since Beijing imposed the National Security Law on Hong Kong in June 2020, at least 14 independent media outlets have been shuttered, including Apple Daily in June 2021 and Stand News in December 2021. The two influential outlets were forced to close following high-profile police raids and arrests of their editors for national security crimes.</p><p>Two journalists for Stand News were&nbsp;convicted of “sedition” under the Crimes Ordinance in August 2024. The Hong Kong government has also repeatedly&nbsp;harassed the Hong Kong Journalists’ Association and journalists, demanding back taxes without any evident basis.</p><p>“Foreign governments should respond to the travesty of Jimmy Lai’s trial by pressing the Hong Kong authorities to quash the case and release him immediately,” Pearson said. “The Chinese and Hong Kong governments should pay a cost for their unrelenting efforts to muzzle Hong Kong’s press.”</p>",

In the United States, the states of&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Oregon, and&nbsp;Missouri banned child marriage.In September, 92 countries met for the first time to formally consider a possible&nbsp;new international treaty to guarantee free education for all children from pre-primary through secondary school. To date, 60 countries have pledged their support for a treaty.Thailand, Czechia, and Switzerland banned all corporal punishment of children, bringing the total number of countries with such bans to 70.The&nbsp;United States and&nbsp;Kosovo endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to protect education during war, bringing the number of countries endorsing the declaration to 122.China initiated a subsidy program for families with children under age 3, while Fiji, Japan, Morocco, Türkiye, and Tunisia increased benefits for children, and the United Kingdom announced it will remove the “two-child limit” for families receiving child-related social security support. Such measures can play a powerful role in reducing child poverty: in the UK alone, ending the two-child limit is projected to lift about 450,000 children out of relative low income by 2030.The International Criminal Court prosecutor&nbsp;requested arrest warrants against two senior Taliban leaders for serious abuses against women and girls in Afghanistan, citing gender persecution, a crime against humanity.The Western Australia state government announced a&nbsp;new reparations program for the “Stolen Generations,” Indigenous children who were forcibly removed from their families under racist policies that began in the early 1900s and lasted into the 1970s.<p>Children around the world continue to face serious threats to their rights, but these examples demonstrate that real improvements are achievable.</p>",

The UN said that about 200,000 people have fled the fighting, including over 30,000 who crossed into Burundi.</p><p>“The Washington Accords addressing the situation in eastern Congo have not resulted in greater security or access to assistance for civilians near Uvira in South Kivu,” said Clémentine de Montjoye, senior Great Lakes researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The warring parties are continuing to commit atrocities and hinder humanitarian assistance and should be held to account.”</p><p>The humanitarian situation in Uvira and its vicinity is dire. Hospitals and health centers have been overwhelmed at a time when humanitarian assistance has dropped because of lack of access and funding shortfalls. Refugees in Burundi told Human Rights Watch they were receiving little to no assistance. The UN World Food Programme has suspended its assistance across South Kivu. Rwandan and M23 authorities should guarantee access to items essential for people’s survival, such as water, food, and medicine.</p><p>UN and military sources told Human Rights Watch that several thousand Rwandan soldiers, including special forces, crossed the border into Congo in recent weeks.</p><p>During the first week of December, Rwandan and M23 forces captured towns and villages on the road to Uvira, including Luvungi, Mutarule, and Sange. Sources reported artillery shelling, attack drones, and other explosive weapons being used in the offensive. The United States told the UN Security Council on December 12 that “Rwanda has [recently] deployed multiple surface-to-air missiles and other heavy and sophisticated weaponry into North and South Kivu to aid M23.”</p><p>“The drones dropped bombs on the population and people’s houses,” said a 60-year-old man from Luvungi who fled to Burundi. “I saw people trying to flee the fighting or hiding in their houses killed, including children in Mutarule.”&nbsp;</p><p>Several explosions in the Sange town center killed at least 36 people, including civilians, based on videos verified by Human Rights Watch and a local human rights defender and media reports. UN and local sources told Human Rights Watch that the explosions were the result of drone attacks and internal fighting between the Congolese army and the Wazalendo.&nbsp;</p><p>A video filmed on December 7 shows more than 20 bodies strewn across a street near the main intersection. Some are in military uniforms, but most are in civilian clothing, and some appear to be children. A civil society source said a family of five was killed in one explosion, including children ages 13 and 15. Three videos filmed on December 9 show volunteers digging graves on the side of the main road about 30 meters from the location of the bodies.</p><p>On December 9, a radio journalist, Janvier Lwesho Nyakirigo, and his brother were killed in an explosion at their house in Kiliba, 11 kilometers north of Uvira, two local sources said.</p><p>Concerns for the safety of civilians in South Kivu have been heightened by rising tensions and grave violations of international humanitarian law by the parties to the conflict. After capturing Goma and Bukavu, the provincial capitals of North and South Kivu, in early 2025, M23 fighters carried out widespread abuses, including summary executions, forced recruitment drives, and sexual violence. The M23 also unlawfully transferred Congolese citizens and Rwandan refugees to Rwanda.</p><p>Several human rights defenders and journalists in Uvira and newly occupied territories have expressed concern to Human Rights Watch that they will face retaliation for their work, as did others after the capture of Goma and Bukavu.</p><p>After the M23 took control of Uvira on December 10, their fighters committed abuses. On December 10, in Kasenga neighborhood, M23 fighters shot and killed two 25-year-old men in civilian clothing after accusing them of being Wazalendo fighters, relatives and witnesses said. The M23 fighters also detained and later executed a 57-year-old man after he refused to hand over his phone, a relative and witness said.</p><p>On December 11 and 12, M23 fighters continued to execute young men and suspected Wazalendo fighters, including apparently unarmed people in civilian clothing, based on several residents and&nbsp;media reports. When a relative of a man killed went to collect his body from Kavimvira neighborhood, he said he saw scores of bodies there, which a UN source confirmed.</p><p>Throughout 2025, Congolese soldiers and Wazalendo fighters have also summarily executed and committed sexual violence against civilians. Wazalendo fighters have also harassed, threatened, abducted, and restricted access to basic services for members of the Banyamulenge community in Uvira, who are South Kivu-based Congolese Tutsis, accusing them of supporting the M23.</p><p>Four Uvira residents said that Congolese soldiers and Wazalendo fighters harassed civilians and looted houses as they retreated from the city. On December 10, Wazalendo fighters summarily killed a member of the Banyamulenge community, Congolese army Lt. Munyakuru Mushambaro, in Kabindula neighborhood, military sources and a neighbor reported. “They started shooting at the door; he tried to escape but they shot him and killed him on the spot,” said the witness. “They began singing anti-Tutsi songs, saying ‘now a Rwandan is dead, he got what he deserved.’”</p><p>The offensive on Uvira came days after the signing ceremony of the US-brokered Washington Accords on December 4. While the accord and its economic framework call for some peacekeeping measures, such as the removal of Rwandan troops from Congo, the agreement’s broad commitments need to be enforced, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The United States, European Union, and African Union should increase humanitarian assistance and press the governments of Burundi, Congo, and Rwanda to prioritize protecting civilians, ensure humanitarian access, and provide safe passage for civilians seeking to flee the fighting. The US and EU should urgently adopt new targeted sanctions against Rwandan officials responsible for, or complicit in, violations of international law, while swiftly reviewing their cooperation with Rwanda—including in the security and minerals sectors—to ensure they are not fueling further abuses.</p><p>Governments should also press countries in the region to facilitate access to the newly created UN Commission of Inquiry on eastern Congo to carry out vital evidence collection and documentation. They should call for an end to the impunity and take action to ensure that commanders and officials responsible for serious human rights violations are held accountable.</p><p>On December 12, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the latest escalation in the conflict. The US delegation accused Kigali of being “intimately involved” in planning and executing the conflict and said Rwanda had at least 5,000 to 7,000 troops in eastern Congo before this latest offensive began, despite Rwanda’s denials.</p><p>Guarantors of the Washington Accords should go beyond condemnation and take strong action to enforce compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The situation facing South Kivu’s civilians is becoming increasingly perilous and the humanitarian needs are enormous,” de Montjoye said. “Unless those responsible for abuses face serious consequences, given the events of the past year, the worst may be yet to come.”</p>",

The system, known as the Centralized Information and Digital Analytics System (MİRAS), will be controlled by the State Security Service and fully operational by May 2026.</p><p>MİRAS is designed to consolidate public data from multiple state bodies— including the Special State Service for communications and information security, and the Interior Ministry—centralize its processing and storage, and provide security services with potentially unfettered access to this information. An explanatory document describing the system’s scope was briefly posted online and then removed, raising concerns about transparency and the breadth of data to be captured.</p><p>This new regulation authorizes MİRAS to collect and analyze a wide range of personal data, including identity documents, migration history, family information, health records, property and financial data, criminal and administrative records, and certain communications metadata. It allows the State Security Service to integrate these data sources and generate forecasts, risk assessments, and analytical reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Azerbaijan is a highly authoritarian state with a&nbsp;well-documented history of unlawful digital surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and activists. Past investigations have&nbsp;shown authorities’ use of internet traffic monitoring tools and spyware to monitor and intimidate critics. Against this backdrop, a centralized system that consolidates sensitive personal data across sectors and institutions—without strong, independent oversight—poses serious risks of arbitrary or disproportionate surveillance.</p><p>As a member of the Council of Europe, Azerbaijan is bound by the European Convention on Human Rights, including Article 8 on the right to privacy. The European Court of Human Rights has&nbsp;repeatedly&nbsp;held that surveillance measures must meet strict standards of legality, necessity, and proportionality, and include independent oversight, transparent rules, and effective remedies.</p><p>The MİRAS regulation lacks these safeguards. It does not specify when or how personal data may be accessed, requires no judicial or independent authorization, and provides no retention limits, minimization standards, or external audit mechanisms. It centralizes control entirely within the State Security Service and includes no public reporting or procedures for individuals to access or correct their data.</p><p>Azerbaijan should suspend implementation of MİRAS and adopt robust privacy protections. International partners, including the Council of Europe, should press the authorities to ensure that supposed digital governance reforms do not entrench unchecked surveillance powers.</p>",

Over 10,000 buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed there between October 2023 and January 2025.</p><p>“Amid the ceasefire, Israeli forces have carried out attacks that unlawfully target reconstruction-related equipment and facilities,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “After reducing many of Lebanon’s southern border towns to rubble, the Israeli military is now making it much more difficult for tens of thousands of residents to rebuild their destroyed homes and return to their towns.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch investigated four attacks on reconstruction-related sites, including three on six outdoor showrooms and maintenance facilities for bulldozers, excavators, and heavy-machinery in the southern Lebanese towns of Deir Seryan, Msayleh, and Ansariyeh, as well as an attack on a cement and asphalt factory in Sinay. The strikes, between August and October 2025, months after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, killed 3 civilians and injured at least 11 people.</p><p>Researchers visited the sites and interviewed 13 people, including owners of the storage and maintenance facilities, mayors of the towns, a manager at the cement and asphalt factory, a government contractor, and three people working at an international nongovernmental organization providing aid in southern Lebanon. Human Rights Watch also reviewed inventory documents and contracts provided by three site owners.</p><p>The four attacks destroyed over 360 heavy machines, including bulldozers and excavators, in addition to an asphalt and cement factory. Owners of heavy machinery sites said that they sold or rented machinery throughout various areas of Lebanon, and that some of the machines that they sold or rented were used for civilian reconstruction efforts, including rubble clearing.</p><p>“We can’t even clear the rubble [from our sites] because we’re afraid that, if we clear it, more of the machines we’re using for rubble-clearing might be struck,” said Ibrahim Karim, owner of a site in Deir Seryan.&nbsp;“So here, we’ve moved the rubble with our own hands.”</p><p>For each of the attacks, Israeli forces had issued statements that the equipment and materials were used by Hezbollah or “allowed,” “enabled” or were “intended” to be used by Hezbollah to “rebuild” or “reestablish” its “assets,” “activity,” or “infrastructure,” without revealing any details.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets in and around the sites. Researchers were able to verify that some of the machinery and supplies were being utilized for civilian purposes. Researchers were unable to verify the use of all machinery and materials that were attacked but did not find any evidence of their use for military purposes by Hezbollah.</p><p>Owners and employees all said that they did not know whether they were working with Hezbollah’s military wing. They said that they do not typically ask clients for their political affiliations and that they sell and fix heavy machinery to whoever requests their services.</p><p>Hezbollah has both a military wing (known as the Islamic Resistance, or al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya) and nonmilitary organizations, such as its political party, its healthcare institutions, and its social welfare organizations. Like other Lebanese political parties, Hezbollah has thousands of members who are not actively involved in any aspect of its military operations.</p><p>However, even in instances in which civilian equipment was being sold or maintained for people with links to Hezbollah, that would not in itself make the sites or the machinery legitimate military targets.</p><p>Based on the evidence Human Rights Watch gathered, the possible contributions that the targeted machinery and sites may have been able to confer on Hezbollah’s military capability is too vague or tenuous to make these objects lawful targets. Permitting such attacks could effectively make all heavy machinery and factories producing materials for construction military objectives subject to attack.</p><p>Israeli forces have also repeatedly carried out unlawful attacks on heavy machinery for reconstruction and other vital civilian infrastructure and hampered reconstruction efforts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p><p>Human Rights Watch sent a letter outlining its findings and posing questions to the Israeli military on December 3. The Israeli military responded with a question, which Human Rights Watch responded to, but subsequently the Israeli military did not provide any further response to the questions posed.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross’ authoritative study of customary laws of war provides that warring parties can only target legitimate military objectives: that is, objects that by their nature, location, purpose or use “make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”</p><p>The mere possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution for military purposes, such as to build fortifications, does not constitute a legitimate military target. Individuals who order deliberate attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure are responsible for war crimes.</p><p>Israel’s key allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, should urgently act to press Israel to cease all attacks on civilian objects and reconstruction-related efforts, including by immediately suspending military assistance and arms sales to Israel and imposing targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in grave crimes. Lebanon’s judicial authorities should initiate domestic investigations of serious international crimes, and the government should accede to the International Criminal Court’s Rome Statute and submit a declaration accepting the court’s jurisdiction prior to the date of accession, including since at least October 7, 2023.</p><p>“The return of tens of thousands of Lebanon’s displaced residents to their homes and villages hinges upon the ability of governments to press Israel to halt its attacks on reconstruction efforts,” Kaiss said. “They should immediately suspend arms to Israel and impose targeted sanctions on officials credibly implicated in ongoing grave crimes.”</p><p>Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect in November 2024, more than 64,000 people in Lebanon remain displaced. Ongoing Israeli strikes have killed at least 127 civilians since the ceasefire, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), and have destroyed civilian infrastructure. According to UN experts, there have been “four incidents of projectiles fired from Lebanon toward Israel since the ceasefire, none of which resulted in casualties.”</p><p>The owners of two sites said that they had sold some machines to international organizations, including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), or to municipalities that were funded by donations from UNDP and USAID. At two of the sites, researchers found remnants consistent with a US-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit, including a tail fin remnant with markings displaying a CAGE code for Boeing and a JDAM tail unit assembly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />In addition to the attacks Human Rights Watch documented, other media outlets have reported additional Israeli strikes that, they said, have destroyed reconstruction equipment and efforts. Public Works Studio, a Lebanese research and design studio working on issues related to reconstruction, housing, and public spaces, said that between December 2024 and November 2025, the Israeli military conducted 46 attacks on vehicles working to remove rubble and clear roads in southern Lebanon, 32 attacks on prefabricated rooms and houses set-up by residents returning to their villages, and 6 on concrete mixers, quarries, stone and aluminum factories, and wood sawmills.</p><p>On November 25, the spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Thameen Al-Kheetan, said Israeli forces had “severely hampered reconstruction efforts and attempts by internally displaced people to go back to their homes in southern Lebanon,” including through attacks on the cement and asphalt factory. He said that Israeli attacks have “destroyed and damaged civilian infrastructure, including housing units, roads, factories and construction sites,” and that Israel’s recent construction of a wall, which crosses into Lebanese territory, has “affect[ed] people’s right to return to their lands.”</p>Deir Siryan: August 6, 15 Machines  \n\n\n\n      \n\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n          \n                      \n      \n          A destroyed excavator from Israeli strikes on August 6, 2025 on Deir Seryan, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch \n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          A destroyed excavator from Israeli strikes on August 6, 2025 on Deir Seryan, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch \n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          Ibrahim Karim, standing in front of one of the damaged bulldozers from Israeli strikes on August 6, 2025 on Deir Seryan, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n      \n      \n\n  \n\n  \n<p>On the night of August 6, 2025, Israeli forces struck two bulldozer maintenance facilities in Deir Seryan in southern Lebanon. The strikes killed one person, a Syrian worker at one of the sites, and injured two others, according to the owners and Lebanon’s&nbsp;Ministry of Health.</p><p>Researchers visited the two sites on November 21 and observed destroyed bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery, as well as damaged homes. Human Rights Watch spoke to the owners of the two sites, Ibrahim Karim and Hussein Khalil Karim, who are cousins, as well as Ibrahim’s nephew, Hussein Mohammed Karim, who works with him.</p><p>Both Ibrahim and Hussein Khalil own several heavy machines, including bulldozers, excavators and cement rollers that they rent out to municipalities and private individuals working in construction and agriculture. They also own hundreds of spare parts that they use to fix machines that others bring to them. The strikes damaged all of their machinery and spare parts, as well as about a dozen machines owned by others that were on site for maintenance. The strikes also destroyed their personal vehicles and damaged their homes.</p><p>They estimated the damage to the machines and spare parts at US$1.3-1.4 million.</p><p>At one of the sites, researchers found remnants of a Boeing-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail unit assembly.</p><p>Ibrahim said that most of their clients were from the South Lebanon Council, a government entity established in 1970 to carry out projects aimed at “meeting the needs of [southern Lebanon] and providing means of safety and stability.” He said that individuals had also been renting their machines to remove rubble from destroyed villages, which he had witnessed as he had gone to check on the machines while they were rented out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“When we rent our machines, we go almost every day to check on them, to fill them with diesel, and fix any issues with them,” Ibrahim said.</p><p>The Syrian worker killed was living in the bottom floor of Khalil’s home. The strike also injured Ibrahim’s wife and brother Hussein Khalil, who were both at their homes. Six children, ages 5-12, were at one of the homes, Ibrahim said. “Our house is 40 meters away from the site,” he said.&nbsp;“My wife was injured as a result of the shattering glass.”</p><p>Hussein Khalil, Ibrahim, and Lebanese media all reported that that the initial strikes were followed by others.</p><p>“When the strikes happened, I was nearby in the village on my motorcycle and heard the strikes that happened on our place and our cousin’s place,” Hussein Khalil Karim said. “I quickly came with my motorcycle, and I took my sister from the house and dropped her off in the neighboring village. And then I came back and saw that there were additional strikes on the machines. One of the strikes “hit a bulldozer and the metal shrapnel from the missile killed a Syrian worker.”</p><p>He said that the strikes had destroyed 14 heavy machines at his site, including excavators, bulldozers, six-wheeler trucks, and pick-up trucks, in addition to spare parts used in maintenance operations.</p><p>The day of the strike, the Israeli military&nbsp;stated&nbsp;on its Telegram channel that its forces had “struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in southern Lebanon,” including “Hezbollah weapons storage facilities, a missile launcher and Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure which stored engineering tools that allowed for the reestablishment of terrorist infrastructure in the area.” The statement did not specify whether it was referring to the attacks in Deir Siryan.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets at or around the site, and the possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution to military purposes does not in itself make it a legitimate military target.</p>Ansariyeh: September 3, 46 Machines  \n\n\n\n      \n\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n          \n                      \n      \n           A destroyed bulldozer and other damaged heavy machinery from an Israeli airstrike on September 3, 2025 on Ansariyeh, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          Damaged heavy machinery from an Israeli airstrike on September 3, 2025 on Ansariyeh, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch \n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          Damaged excavators from an Israeli airstrike on September 3, 2025 on Ansariyeh, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch \n      \n      \n\n  \n\n  \n<p>At about 10:00 p.m. on September 3, the Israeli military struck a heavy machinery showroom and maintenance facility in the southern Lebanese village of Ansariyeh, destroying 46 heavy machines, including bulldozers and excavators, in addition to hundreds of spare parts, according to the owner. While 12 of the destroyed machines belonged to Mohammed Kiniar, the owner, the rest belonged to customers who had sent their machines for repair, he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A building on the site had been hit by Israel a year earlier, on September 27, 2024, Kiniar said.</p><p>Researchers visited the site on November 21 and observed dozens of destroyed bulldozers, excavators, and other heavy machinery, as well as hundreds of spare parts and equipment used to restore machinery. The owner said that machinery destroyed in the September 3, 2025, strike included agricultural bulldozers, smaller “Bobcat” bulldozers, and excavators.</p><p>A Syrian man was killed in the strike, said Kiniar and the mayor of the town, Abbas Fakih, and three people were lightly injured.</p><p>Fakih and Kiniar both said that the strike happened just over an hour after workers at the site had finished unloading two containers of Bobcat bulldozers and other spare parts that the company had imported to Lebanon. The day of the strike, workers had also been repairing bulldozers belonging to the Zahrani Union of Municipalities, which includes 15 municipalities, in addition to an excavator belonging to another Lebanese contractor, Kiniar said.</p><p>“That day we heard drones over our head the entire day,” the mayor said. “We heard two different drones. The drones must have seen them emptying the containers.”</p><p>At the site, researchers saw dozens of burned or damaged bulldozers, excavators and spare parts.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiniar said that the strikes destroyed 46 heavy machines, with damages amounting to $3.6 million. He said that he established the site in 2003 and has sold various heavy machinery to international organizations, such as UNDP and municipalities, and has repaired heavy machinery for government contractors and a UN peacekeepers battalion.</p><p>“I’m a trader,” Kiniar said. “I sell to everyone, and I try to fix every machine that comes here. My customers come from all over Lebanon.”</p><p>On November 21, Human Rights Watch spoke to a Lebanese contractor and owner of the contracting company South for Construction S.A.L., Riad al-Assaad, who had sent an excavator to the site for repairs two days before the site was struck.

The strikes killed one person, a Syrian national, and injured&nbsp;seven others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lebanon’s&nbsp;National News Agency reported that just after 4:00 a.m. on October 11, “more than 11 strikes directly targeted a group of bulldozer and excavator showrooms” resulting in “the destruction of more than 300 vehicles, including bulldozers and excavators, among them more than 100 small ‘Bobcat’ vehicles.” The agency reported that the five sites that were completely destroyed “are considered among the largest machinery showrooms in Lebanon” and that five other separate sites were also damaged from the attacks.</p><p>On November 14, Human Rights Watch researchers visited four of the outdoor showrooms and interviewed the four owners, including Ahmad and Imad Tabaja, a father and son who said they lost 139 machines and spare parts worth a total of about $4.7 million in the attack, as well as the owners of two other showrooms targeted.</p><p>At the two plots owned by the Tabaja family, Human Rights Watch saw dozens of machines and hundreds of spare parts that had been completely destroyed in the attack. Most machines were completely burned and their metal had been warped by the blast. At one of the family’s sites Human Rights Watch also found weapons remnants and determined that they were consistent with a JDAM guidance kit assembled and sold by a US company.</p><p>Researchers reviewed documents provided by the owners, including a detailed inventory of 139 destroyed pieces of equipment, among them heavy machines, generators and various spare parts, and the owners’ estimates of damages.</p><p>Ahmad Tabaja, the father, said that he has imported machines for use in the agricultural sector, including tractors, excavators, rollers, and bobcat bulldozers since 1967.</p><p>He and his son, Imad, said that their clients have included government contractors working with the Energy and Water Ministry and the Public Works Ministry, as well as municipalities. He said that UN agencies and USAID had provided the funding for some municipalities to purchase equipment from them. Researchers also reviewed receipts issued by the Tabaja family company, between 2018 and 2025, for heavy machinery and spare parts purchased from the site by municipalities, Lebanese and international companies, in addition to the US-based Near East Foundation.</p><p>Imad said that they sold equipment across all of Lebanon, but that since October 2023, much of their sales had been to individuals and contractors outside of southern Lebanon due to hostilities there. Ahmed added that about 10 percent of their sales were also international.</p><p>“All our shipment containers have come in legally through customs,” Imad said. “The government typically estimates the price of each imported container. In total, the price of our imports is $4.7 million. Everything was destroyed [in the strikes].”</p><p>The owner of another site, Ali Tarhini, said that eight of his ten six-wheeler trucks were completely destroyed, and two partially destroyed, in the strikes, resulting in between $400,000 to $500,000 in losses. “I’ve been working in this business for nearly 30-35 years, and I’ve been in Msayleh for 4 years,” he said. “I just sell to regular people. Whoever comes and wants to buy [trucks], we sell to them.”</p><p>Another owner, Mohammed Chahine, showed researchers the damage on his site, which borders the Tabaja family’s site. Chahine provided an inventory of the damages at his site, including three damaged hydraulic winches, used in digging and preparing water wells, in addition to a car, a prefabricated house, submersible water pumps, generators, solar panels, lithium batteries and spare parts, which totaled $770,000 in losses.</p><p>Chahine said that he has been working at this site in Msayleh since 1990 and has worked with municipalities, government contractors, the South Lebanon Council, and the South Lebanon Water Establishment, the public utility responsible for supplying water across southern Lebanon. On the site, researchers found damaged vehicles, solar panels, a container that stored salvaged spare parts for solar panel systems, in addition to a hangar where Chahine stored other spare parts for the hydraulic winches.</p><p>The Israeli military&nbsp;stated on Telegram on the day of the strike that its forces had “struck and dismantled Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of southern Lebanon, where engineering machinery used to reestablish terrorist infrastructure in the area they were located.\" The statement did not specify whether it was referring to the attacks in Msayleh.</p><p>Human Rights Watch did not find evidence of military targets at or around the site, and the possibility that equipment could be used in an undefined, future contribution to military purposes does not in itself make it a legitimate military target.</p>Sinay: October 16, Cement and Asphalt Factory  \n\n\n\n      \n\n                                                  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n  \n          \n                      \n      \n          Aftermath of Israeli strikes on October 16, 2025, on an asphalt and cement factory in Sinay, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          Aftermath of Israeli strikes on October 16, 2025, on an asphalt and cement factory in Sinay, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n      \n          \n                      \n      \n          Aftermath of Israeli strikes on October 16, 2025, on an asphalt and cement factory in Sinay, southern Lebanon. © 2025 Human Rights Watch\n      \n      \n\n  \n\n  \n<p>Israeli forces attacked a large cement and asphalt factory in Sinay on October 16.

According to both the mayor and the administrative manager, the cost of the destruction totaled over $10 million.</p><p>“After the ceasefire we had about a 30 percent increase in our work, probably all related to reconstruction,” the manager at the site said. “But we don’t ask people why are you buying this cement or this asphalt.

A second assailant was taken into custody.</p><p>“An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian,” said Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&nbsp;last night at a press conference. “Australia will never submit to division, violence or hatred.”</p><p>Strong political leadership is vital in ensuring everyone can live in safety and practice their religious beliefs.

Subcontractors and others in the supply chain are also affected and themselves shortchange workers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Clients at the top of the Qatari contracting supply chain, including government bodies, often have impunity, leaving subcontracting businesses that employ migrant workers bearing the cost,” said&nbsp;Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Influential contractors and employers in Qatar should stop stiffing workers by failing to pay subcontractors what they owe.”</p><p>Between February and March 2024 and in September 2025, Human Rights Watch interviewed 16 people who had been employed by Qatar labor supply companies. Human Rights Watch also reviewed contractual agreements and email correspondence from two subcontractors. One employed thousands of migrant workers, including for Qatari government agencies and large-scale construction companies. The other was a labor supply company. Names of those interviewed are withheld because they fear retaliation.&nbsp;</p><p>Documents reviewed showed that both subcontractors struggled to pay workers when their clients did not release payments as contractually obligated. Multiple attempts by one to demand payment, including threats of legal action, did not yield payment, causing knock-on effects throughout the subcontracting chain. &nbsp;</p><p>When clients do not make timely payments, they may be complicit in contributing to wage theft against migrant workers, as many companies do not have the financial resources to pay workers until they themselves are paid. Human Rights Watch reviewed contracts specifying payment within 45 days of invoice submission, but payments had been delayed by almost a year.&nbsp;</p><p>“Non-payment by clients has badly affected our cash flow, as we couldn't pay our suppliers and subcontractors that we have engaged in our project,” a subcontracting company representative said. “We are also facing legal threats from them. The company has not been able to pay its own workers’ salaries either.”&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed letters supporting this claim, including those sent to clients that laid out the adverse outcomes and requested payment, as well as letters to downstream suppliers attempting to justify the payment delays, requesting payment extensions, and urging them to pause any legal proceedings.</p><p>Interviews revealed that when demands for payment via written notices, letters, or client visits don’t work, subcontractors consider legal remedy. Yet these avenues do not always yield positive results, and powerful clients even dismiss warnings from contractors about initiating legal action, Human Rights Watch found.&nbsp;</p><p>Human Rights Watch has&nbsp;documented that a “pay when paid” clause included in contracts can contribute to wage theft, and Qatar should instead extend liability for wages beyond the immediate employer in subcontracting chains. In addition to payment delays, interviews revealed that the underutilization of days or personnel compared with what is contractually agreed upon and project extensions or changes to the scope of a project without corresponding increases in budget also harm workers.</p><p>Multiple workers employed by at least five labor supply companies said that their management often delayed their wages and told them that they would be paid once the client company pays them. “The [client] company did not care until we stopped showing for work because we went on strike,” a worker said.&nbsp;</p><p>In other cases, however, labor supply companies may not pay even when paid by the client company, highlighting the need for strict oversight. One letter reviewed showed that the client company demanded that a subcontractor pay their workers after workers complained to them directly.</p><p>Client companies have enormous power over labor supply companies’ business practices that they contract with, enabling abuses when they fail to conduct proper due diligence. Businesses have&nbsp;responsibilities to uphold human rights throughout their operations. Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>Labor supply companies are at the bottom of often long and complex subcontracting chains. Human Rights Watch research in Gulf states has found that migrant workers employed by labor&nbsp;supply companies often face more abuses than those directly hired by companies. “Even when we are doing identical work, the company hires were paid almost double our salary,” one worker said. “How can we justify that?”&nbsp;</p><p>Labor supply companies sometimes submit low bids and keep overall operating costs low by paying low wages. Clients often do not inquire about wages paid in their subcontracting chains, interviews revealed. “It would have been better if the client company set a minimum salary out of the lump sum amount they pay per worker,” a worker said.</p><p>Workers described terrible living and commuting conditions at labor supply companies. “Even though my [work] duty started at 6:00 a.m., I had to wake up at 2:00 a.m., because the company adjusted schedules.” a worker said. “They dropped us at our site 90 minutes early to accommodate for other workers’ schedules.”&nbsp;</p><p>Workers said they lived in overcrowded rooms and had inadequate water and electricity access and unhygienic restrooms. One worker lost 55 pounds in his first year working in Qatar due to the physically demanding work and the inedible food. He said, “Nothing was fresh. The chicken had blood in it.”</p><p>Another worker said, “From [the client’s] perspective, they have basically bought us… and try to squeeze us to the maximum.” This was reflected in a contract between a contractor and labor supply company reviewed by Human Rights Watch, which reads: “[Labor Supply Company] will supply the required manpower, taking production from the workers and utilizing them to the maximum is the responsibility of [Client Company].”&nbsp;</p><p>Neither the bare-bones contract nor the bid specified standards for meals, accommodation, transportation, or any other human rights obligations of either party. The incomplete contracts also explicitly breached the labor law by setting minimum daily hours worked at 10 instead of 8. Even when work is irregular, employers did not allow workers to transfer jobs and instead told them to leave the country and come back on a new visa, workers said.</p><p>In migrant communities, “labor supply companies” are viewed as a risky choice. However, aspiring migrant workers are often misled by recruiters to believe that they are direct hires or are unable to distinguish supply companies.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the International Labour Organization conventions&nbsp;ratified by Qatar, including the Forced Labor Convention (No. 29), withholding and non-payment of wages is a coercive practice that may amount to forced labor.&nbsp;</p><p>Under Qatar’s Civil Code, subcontractors and workers can claim payment directly from the client if the contractor fails to pay.</p><p>Qatari authorities should hold major companies responsible for labor abuses committed by subcontractors and labor supply companies. All businesses should uphold worker protections across their operations and supply chains.</p><p>“Qatari authorities are failing twice over to protect migrant workers, first as clients themselves fail to pay contractors for work on time and second as ineffective regulators,” Page said. “Highly touted systems like the Wage Protection System and the Wage Support and Insurance Fund are insufficient to prevent and remedy rampant wage theft.”&nbsp;</p>",

Dong had been writing for a Chinese government newspaper, Guangming Daily, for 35 years before his arrest.</p><p>In September, a court sentenced a citizen-journalist, Zhang Zhan, 42, to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking troubles.” Zhang had previously served four years in prison under the same article for her reporting on the Covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan.</p><p>After Zhang’s second conviction, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said the crime of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble … given its broad wording and the wide scope of its potential application to those exercising their rights, including freedom of expression and association,” is “at variance with China’s international human rights obligations.”</p><p>In June 2024, a court in Guangzhou sentenced a feminist activist and journalist, Huang Xueqin, 37, to five years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power” for her writing, including about the 2019 Hong Kong protests and her role in the #MeTooMovement.</p><p>In Hong Kong, Jimmy Lai, 78, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon and owner of the shuttered Apple Daily is facing up to life in prison on two fabricated “foreign collusion” charges under Hong Kong’s draconian National Security Law.</p><p>“Concerned governments should publicly raise Du Bin’s case with the Chinese government and press for his immediate and unconditional release,” Uluyol said. “By bringing baseless charges against its critics, Beijing is merely broadcasting to the world the fragility of its rule.”&nbsp;</p>",

This latest anti-migrant rhetoric comes at the same time as the EU’s wave of regressive and cruel measures.</p><p>Earlier this week, EU home affairs ministers agreed to the European Commission’s proposals to offshore migration responsibilities despite human rights concerns. The centerpiece of discussions was what is referred to in the new policy as the “Return Regulation,” which aims to increase deportations of rejected asylum seekers and migrants.</p><p>EU member states would be allowed to conclude agreements with third countries to establish “return hubs” outside EU territory where individuals scheduled for deportation could be sent. The Commission’s draft provides no clarity on applicable law or accountability, and EU governments want to eliminate even the existing minimal monitoring provisions. The agreement broadens detention grounds, greatly increasing the risk of prolonged or indefinite detention. Such measures have&nbsp;no demonstrated effect on return rates, nor are they cost-effective.</p><p>EU law enforcement authorities will now also demand onerous cooperation from third-country nationals subject to a deportation order. These obligations impose requirements that many individuals are unlikely to be able to meet for reasons like lack of identity documents or a fixed residence, risking entry bans and financial or even criminal sanctions. New “detection” measures raise concerns about surveillance and racial profiling, and would legitimize discriminatory policing that targets racialized communities.</p><p>Since the Commission’s proposal was adopted,&nbsp;civil society organizations have called on governments to reject these inhumane deportation rules and&nbsp;reconsider the alarming direction of ongoing negotiations.</p><p>Under other policies agreed this week, EU states could send asylum seekers to a third country deemed “safe” even in absence of any meaningful connection between the asylum seeker and that country. The officials also endorsed an EU list of “safe countries of origin” whose nationals will automatically be subject to fast-track asylum procedures, often at border or transit zones, where individuals at risk of persecution may be denied proper assessment.</p><p>Respect for human rights and the rule of law is enshrined in the binding EU founding treaties. Return rules that violate fundamental rights are not only unlawful but also come at a considerable cost to human beings and the EU’s stated values.</p>",

The French government is also increasingly using heavy-handed administrative measures to silence legitimate dissent, a trend I can confirm myself based on my work at Human Rights Watch, focusing on restrictions on civil society.</p><p>The&nbsp;2021&nbsp;“separatism law” gives the government broad powers to&nbsp;shut down nongovernmental groups by ministerial decree, and obliges organizations to sign a&nbsp;“Contract of Republican Engagement” with vague requirements (for example, “refrain from any action that undermines public order”) as a condition for public funds and other benefits from the state. The loose language of the “contract” gives the authorities a wide margin for interpretation, fostering arbitrary decisions to sanction civic organizations. Both tools have created a&nbsp;climate of pressure and&nbsp;self-censorship among civil society.</p><p>Another key factor that led to the downgrade is law enforcement’s abuse of peaceful protesters. For years,&nbsp;nongovernmental organizations,&nbsp;including Human Rights Watch, have&nbsp;documented police use of&nbsp;excessive force during protests, including the use of dangerous crowd control weapons. The United Nations Committee Against Torture, in its May 2025 concluding observations on France,&nbsp;expressed deep concern over numerous allegations of excessive use of force, including lethal force, and ill-treatment by law enforcement officers, noting that these abuses disproportionately affect minority groups. Groups working on Palestine solidarity have also&nbsp;faced restrictions, according to CIVICUS.</p><p>The French government should urgently take note of this downgrade, as well as&nbsp;serious concerns raised by rights bodies,and restore respect for civic space in line with its international and EU fundamental rights obligations, and under the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Commission, as the guardian of EU treaties, should use its annual&nbsp;Rule of Law report to issue strong recommendations to address the rule of law backsliding in France.</p><p>Human rights groups and other civil society organizations should be able to exercise the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly without fear of arbitrary retaliation.</p>",

Mozambique’s government should work with international agencies to provide sufficient support for people in need.</p><p>Between November 10 and 23, 2025, an armed group linked to the Islamic State-Mozambique, known as Al-Shabab or Mashababos,&nbsp;killed 12 civilians in Cabo Delgado and 21 in Nampula provinces, according to the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data, a nongovernmental monitoring group. The International Organization for Migration&nbsp;reported that during this period, the attacks forced about 108,000 people, including about&nbsp;70,000 children, to flee their homes in Nampula’s Memba district for already&nbsp;overcrowded areas in Eráti and other coastal localities.</p><p>“Displaced people in northern Mozambique, including many children, are living in extremely precarious conditions without adequate food, health care, shelter, and mental health support,” said Sheila Nhancale, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Mozambican authorities need to take immediate measures to meet their needs and protect them from further risks.”</p><p>Local media&nbsp;reported children being separated from their families due to the displacement; older people being abandoned; and&nbsp;dozens sleeping outdoors, exposed to rain and cold and without shelter or adequate food, including women who are&nbsp;pregnant and nursing. Many are living in schools, administrative buildings, and other spaces not designed to shelter people. Hygiene and sanitation conditions at these sites have&nbsp;deteriorated with outbreaks of diarrheal diseases and malaria.</p><p>“We are living under trees, without a safe place to stay,” said a displaced woman in Alua Sede, Eráti district, who has not heard from her husband in more than two weeks since she escaped with her children from Mazua, Memba district. “We urgently ask for help because the situation is becoming unbearable.”</p><p>“Some of the displaced are housed in crowded tents,” said a displaced man at a shelter in Alua Sede. “There are not enough tents, and children are mixed with everyone else. Food is insufficient.”</p><p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) had previously&nbsp;reported that as of late October, about 90,000 people, including 52,000 children, had been displaced by attacks beginning in September across both provinces. The children had limited access to health care, education, and safe shelter. Girls have been exposed to gender-based violence.</p><p>While the Mozambican government has taken steps to respond to the crisis, including mobilizing resources and coordinating with humanitarian partners, its capacity has been&nbsp;overstretched because of the number of people displaced, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“The state’s legal responsibility in these situations is to ensure security and guarantee minimum conditions for survival,” said Isidro Júlio, chairperson of the Provincial Council of the Mozambique Bar Association in Nampula. “This implies arranging a place for these people to live and ensuring access to food, water, and other basic needs.”</p><p>On December 3, Nampula’s governor, Eduardo Abdula,&nbsp;met with civil society organizations, businesspeople, and local authorities to discuss urgent solutions to the humanitarian crisis. The government and humanitarian partners, including UN agencies and international nongovernmental organizations, have begun delivering food and safe water and providing emergency shelter, sanitation and hygiene facilities, some healthcare services, and protection assistance. However, resources remain&nbsp;overstretched as newly displaced people arrive daily.</p><p>OCHA&nbsp;reported that during a three-week period in November, the Nampula provincial government mobilized 100 tons of food, which could only support about 13,500 people for 15 days. The National Institute for Disaster Management also distributed food kits to 8,000 people. During the same period, humanitarian agencies provided assistance to 8,500 people, delivering a package of food, shelter, non-food items, and water and sanitation support. However, the supplies don’t meet the scale of the need.</p><p>Mozambique’s constitution guarantees the rights to life, security, and adequate living conditions, which reinforce regional and international conventions protecting internally displaced people.</p><p>Mozambique is party to the&nbsp;African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), which provides that governments “shall provide sufficient protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, and where available resources are inadequate to enable them to do so, they shall cooperate in seeking the assistance of international organizations and humanitarian agencies, civil society organizations and other relevant actors.”</p><p>Since October 2017, Al-Shabab has&nbsp;attacked numerous villages, killed&nbsp;more than 2,500 people, and&nbsp;destroyed extensive civilian property and infrastructure including schools and health centers in Cabo Delgado. The conflict began in Cabo Delgado and has since spread to neighboring provinces, including some districts in Nampula province, displacing over&nbsp;1.3 million people, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2025, armed groups began striking multiple areas&nbsp;simultaneously, putting some longstanding host communities at risk.</p><p>“The Mozambican government, with additional support from donor countries and humanitarian agencies, should urgently meet the protection and assistance needs of all those displaced, in line with its international obligations,” Nhancale said. “The government should also investigate and appropriately prosecute those responsible for abuses in the current fighting.”</p>",
